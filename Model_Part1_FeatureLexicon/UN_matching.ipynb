      "0 The single most important factor towards achieving the socio-economic development goals will be the success of the education sector in enhancing the social, economic, cultural, environmental, and political capabilities of our most important asset, our people\n",
      "1 Education virtually impacts all dimensions of development and is critical for ensuring sustainable poverty alleviation which can only come through the empowerment of our people, particularly the remote and most vulnerable sections of our population\n",
      "2 An educated citizenry that is able to understand, translate and act upon information, laws, rights and responsibilities is critical for ensuring a \"vibrant democracy\" and effective governance\n",
      "3 Similarly, the realization of our vision of a \"knowledge based society\" is absolutely dependent on a technically skilled workforce with competencies benchmarked to leading industry standards and capabilities to think globally but act locally\n",
      "4 Recognizing this, the education sector continues to remain a strategic priority for the Royal Government and will be given further impetus in the Eleventh Plan.\n",
      "0 Education in Bhutan comprises early childcare development, primary and secondary education, special education for the physically and mentally challenged, non-formal and adult education, monastic education, vocational and technical education and training (TVET) and higher or tertiary education\n",
      "1 The responsibility for the administration of education in Bhutan is shared amongst the Ministry of Education (MoE), the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources (MoLHR), the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB), and the local governments\n",
      "2 Provision of monastic education is facilitated by the central monastic body and privately managed independent monasteries\n",
      "3 Although education plans are centrally coordinated, their implementation has largely been decentralized to local governments, schools and institutions to ensure greater autonomy, accountability and dynamism to achieve desired educational outcomes.\n",
      "0 The school-based education structure comprises of 11 years of free basic education from classes Pre Primary to X, divided into 7 years of primary education (PP-VI), starting at the age of 6, and 4 years of Secondary Education (VII-X)\n",
      "1 At the end of the cycle (Class X) there is a national board examination, Bhutan Certificate for Secondary Education (BCSE)\n",
      "2 Beyond class X, government funded education is based on merit.\n",
      "0 The Bhutan Council for School Examinations and Assessment (BCSEA) conducts the national examinations for classes X and XII\n",
      "1 The examinations for classes VI and VIII have been decentralized to the schools, although the questions, model answers and marking schemes are provided by the BCSEA.\n",
      "0 The TVET system comprises of 8 institutes spread across the country with an intake capacity of about 1,000 students a year and 138 teachers\n",
      "1 Programmes offered vary from 6 months to 2 years at the certificate level in courses ranging from electrical, mechanical, construction engineering, auto-mechanics, driving, computer hardware, carpentry, furniture making\n",
      "2 The two institutes of Zorig Chusum provide 2-6 year programmes in the 13 traditional arts and crafts\n",
      "3 These institutes generally cater to students or school leavers after Class X with the objective of imparting knowledge skills necessary to make them employable in the labour market.\n",
      "0 Tertiary education in Bhutan comprises of three years of undergraduate studies provided by the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) through its 10 constituent colleges located in various parts of the country and one private college, the Royal Thimphu College\n",
      "1 The current total intake of RUB is about 9,000 students\n",
      "2 Under-graduate degree and diploma programmes include civil, mechanical, computer and electrical engineering, natural resources, language and cultural studies, education, traditional medicine, nursing and health science, business and commerce, sciences, and liberal arts studies\n",
      "3 In addition, the Royal Institute of Management provides post-graduate diploma and diploma programmes ranging from 1 to 2 years in management and development, finance and business, ICT, and law\n",
      "4 It recently introduced post graduate degree courses in public administration and management.\n",
      "0 The Monastic body reports that there are 7,240 monastic novices in 388 monastic schools and 3 nunneries across Bhutan\n",
      "1 This enrolment is significantly lower than the one reported for 2006, which was 9287.\n",
      "0 5.1.1\tCurrent Situation\n",
      "0 The Ministry of Education's Annual Education Statistics 2013 reports a net primary enrollment ratio (PP to VI) of 96 percent, net basic education enrollment ratio (PP-X) of 94 percent and adult literacy of 55 percent\n",
      "1 Evidently, with high priority accorded to the education sector, Bhutan is well on track to achieve the MDGs\n",
      "2 In terms of the MDGs, the targets for gross primary enrolment ratios, proportion of pupils starting grade 1 who reach grade 5, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary schools and secondary schools have already been achieved while the other targets are well on track to be achieved.\n",
      "0 According to BLSS 2012, the general literacy rate has increased from 59.5 percent in 2005 to 63 percent in 2012\n",
      "1 Literacy is higher in urban areas at 79 percent as compared to 56 percent in rural areas\n",
      "2 In terms of gender, literacy is higher among males at 72 percent as compared to 55 percent for females\n",
      "3 However, the Gender Parity Index is calculated at 1.02, indicating that on the whole there is no significant gender inequality in the Bhutanese education system\n",
      "4 Both boys and girls have equal opportunities in terms of access, quality of learning process, equality of outcomes and external results.\n",
      "0 5.1.2  Key Challenges\n",
      "0 Last mile challenges and disparities at local levels - The Adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (ANER)29 for primary education is 98.5 percent (2013)\n",
      "1 This indicates that 1.5 percent of primary school going age children are out of school\n",
      "2 This 1.5 percent are assumed to be children in remote and hard to reach areas, children of nomadic communities, children with learning disabilities whose special learning needs are yet to be catered for and children of the urban poor.\n",
      "0 Further, while national statistics indicate good progress in overall enrollment rates, the Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010 indicates that some disparities in achievements exist between urban and rural areas, Dzongkhags and genders\n",
      "1 According to the Survey, the adjusted Net Primary Attendance Ratio (NAR) for 2010 indicates that Punakha, Chukha, Mongar, Lhuentse, Wangdue and Gasa are the six Dzongkhags that have the lowest adjusted NAR, significantly below the national average of 91.9 percent\n",
      "2 Similarly, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) reveals that Pemagatshel, Trongsa, Haa, Punakha and Mongar have a variance in their GPI scores by more than 0.03 from 1.0, indicating that some inequity exists in terms of gender participation\n",
      "3 In all of these five Dzongkhags, the participation level of girls in primary education significantly exceeds that of boys\n",
      "4 However, these ratios change in favor of male children as students move to higher classes mainly due to higher drop-out rates among female students.\n",
      "0 Addressing the last mile challenge of enrollment, including disparities at local levels and catering to the special needs of children with disabilities will require innovative and cost effective strategies in the delivery of education.\n",
      "0 Relevance and Quality of Education: In spite of the significant progress made with regard to providing access to education, the quality of education is an issue of growing concern to parents and policy makers\n",
      "1 Judging solely by improvements in efficiency indicators such as drop-out rates, repetition rates, completion rates and survival rates, the quality of education has certainly improved over the years, although some of these rates, such as repetition and dropout rates in class IV and VII, are still undesirably high and need further improvement.\n",
      "0 However, what remains of great concern is that an increasing numbers of our students, including graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are inadequately prepared to enter the workforce\n",
      "1 On the other hand Bhutan continues to face an acute shortage of skilled and highly specialized manpower such as doctors, engineers, ICT experts and teachers\n",
      "2 This has resulted in a paradoxical situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills shortage at the same time\n",
      "3 Furthermore, the rapid socio-economic development and transformative changes that have been taking place, both domestically and globally, require higher standards in education at a scale that has never been met or required before\n",
      "4 The fact that most of our students are unable to meet the admission criteria of top tier tertiary education institutions abroad, particularly for professional courses, is but one testament of the poor learning outcomes of our education not being commensurate to the requirements of youth today\n",
      "5 This calls for building on our strong foundations an education system that is not only free but is of such quality that it provides the knowledge, skills and attitude to allow our people to tap their full potential and succeed\n",
      "6 Given that today the largest section of our population are youth our window of opportunity is small and therefore improving the quality of education is urgent\n",
      "7 Of particular concern in the outcome of education, which is highly relevant to achieving our Plan objective, is weak student performance in the foundational subjects\n",
      "8 In all the countries that have succeeded in the economic areas we strive to develop, the competitive advantage of their education system has been a high level of performance in math and science\n",
      "9 In our case, most students perform poorly in math and science, and have similar weaknesses even in English despite it being the medium of instruction for most subjects at all levels in school and higher education.\n",
      "0 According to Royal Education Council's (REC) research study on the quality of education, the overall trend indicates that there is a big gap between the current and the desired state in the quality of outcomes and processes\n",
      "1 Some of the key deficiencies in the quality of learning outcomes and processes highlighted in the report include:\n",
      "0 The overall level of performance of students is just above passing grades;\n",
      "0 Graduates lack basic analytical and communication skills and the attitudes needed as entry level professions;\n",
      "0 Teaching consists of one way teacher-led chalk-and-talk without being able to get the students to comprehend and demonstrate learning;\n",
      "0 Assessment in the classroom does not close the loop between what is taught and what students learn;\n",
      "0 Low academic and professional standards for entry into teaching profession;\n",
      "0 Schools lack quality processes for developing teachers' capacity, the autonomy and instructional resources to initiate academic improvement and the essential physical infrastructure to support learning;\n",
      "0 No clear link between the stated national socio-economic goals and the goals of the education system;\n",
      "0 The supporting systems for schools need a great degree of strengthening in the areas of teacher preparation, curriculum standards and resources and the incentives for quality.\n",
      "0 The report underscored three critical reasons for the persistence of ineffective classroom practices across schools: namely under-prepared teachers, lack of appropriate curricular resources, and poor instructional leadership and in-service training\n",
      "1 The study recommended a thoughtfully designed and carefully implemented comprehensive reform effort to bridge the gap between the current set of challenges facing our school system and the high aspirations it holds\n",
      "2 Various other studies/reports also suggest that education infrastructure facilities alone are not sufficient to improve education outcomes but adequate, motivated and appropriately qualified teachers play a critical role in ensuring quality education\n",
      "3 However, our education system continues to be constrained by an acute shortage of teachers and limited capacities\n",
      "4 Teaching, today, is the least preferred profession among graduates, and attracting high performing graduates to join teaching is increasingly a major challenge\n",
      "5 Some of the reasons for this include lack of incentives, both financial and non-financial incentives, perceived poor career progression and limitations in the recruitment process\n",
      "6 During the Tenth Plan, initiatives to strengthen human resource policy to provide better career progression for teachers were implemented\n",
      "7 However, the proposed teacher incentives remains unimplemented due to resource constraints.\n",
      "0 The TVET and tertiary education systems are also faced with a similar set of challenges on the issue of relevance and quality of education\n",
      "1 Furthermore, current projections indicate that about 60,000 students would be completing classes 10 and 12 and entering the labour market over the Eleventh Plan\n",
      "2 If we are to close the \"education to employment\" gap, it is vital to ensure that the TVET and tertiary education institutes have the intake capacity to provide relevant and quality post-secondary education and training to ensure their employability.\n",
      "0 According to REC Report 2008, an independent assessment of the TVET system indicates that the content standards of programmes are not reflective of industry standards or requirements; students are inadequately trained upon graduation; the training institutes are under-resourced and faculty under-qualified; and there is a significant \"education to employment gap\" as students do not necessarily follow into the trade for which they have been trained however inadequately.\n",
      "0 There is a widely shared view on the need for the TVET institutes and colleges of RUB to be consolidated along a single-campus and multi-disciplinary model if we are to ensure relevance and quality in our TVET and tertiary education system.\n",
      "0 Sustainability: The share of education sector budget to the five year plan outlays has averaged around 11 percent over the last ten five year plans, with allocation increasing from Nu\n",
      "1 9.4 million during the 1st Plan (1961-1966) to Nu\n",
      "2 10.3 billion in the 10th Plan (2008-13), of which Nu\n",
      "3 875 million was for current expenditure and Nu\n",
      "4 9,489 million for capital expenditure in the Tenth Plan\n",
      "5 The expenditure in the education sector is expected to further increase in coming years particularly with increasing cost of maintenance of past infrastructure investments and additional capital investments to absorb the increasing enrollment pressure at various levels\n",
      "6 In addition, with the phasing out of WFP's assistance after 2018, the government will need to take over the school feeding programme\n",
      "7 The school feeding programme has been one of the important factors contributing to the better enrollment rates.\n",
      "0 5.1.3  Sector Key Result Areas\n",
      "0 The sector key result areas and key performance indicators for TVET and Education sector are as follows:\n",
      "0 5.1.4  Strategies\n",
      "0 Any strategy to strengthen our education system and institutions to the level required to bring about the transformation in our socio-economic development process must ensure that we take a comprehensive stock of the state of our entire education system (spanning school, TVET, higher education, and continuing education) as an integrated whole rather than disparate parts (including regular assessment and diagnostics of student performance and identify the root causes of the mismatch between educational outcomes and our developmental needs); establish clear quality criteria in terms of the desired outcomes that are responsive to the changing expectations of students and are regularly benchmarked to global standards (such as student outcomes and employment, instructional methods, and organizational dynamism); understand the capacity gaps in achieving those criteria; provide a collaborative and highly competent institutional support system that focuses on helping students, teachers and school leaders develop research based innovative strategies of implementation to achieve the desired outcomes and; disseminate those evidence-based effective strategies throughout the system\n",
      "1 This calls for a sustained systemic strategy rather than disparate interventions to address challenges in isolation\n",
      "2 The planning and implementation of such an education strategy certainly requires a longer-term perspective of more than five years\n",
      "3 The experience of top performing education systems like in Finland and Singapore suggest a gestation of at least 20 years\n",
      "4 Most importantly, the strategy must be supported with adequate and predictable resources and the necessary institutional and policy support systems.\n",
      "0 Some of the elements of the strategy for improved outcomes of the education sector, relevant to the school, TVET and tertiary education systems, include:\n",
      "0 •\tClarifying goals and raising performance standards for schools through shared national education goals that are aligned with the national socio-economic goals; learning standards and quality teaching processes;\n",
      "0 •\tCurriculum improvements to deliver educational goals with greater involvement of principals and teachers in curriculum design and communication and training on improved curriculum;\n",
      "0 •\tAttracting the best talent into teaching by recruiting the most capable candidates into teaching and preparing them for effective classroom practice;\n",
      "0 •\tGiving teachers the skills and tools to raise the quality of classroom instruction through continuous professional development and structured teaching-learning resources;\n",
      "0 •\tDeveloping Principals to become Instructional Leaders - through leadership training, professional support and instructional improvement processes;\n",
      "0 •\tEnabling the capacity of schools to focus on learning and teaching through policies to promote autonomy, accountability, incentives and improving the quality of instructional tools and infrastructure facilities to support learning;\n",
      "0 •\tMaintain relentless focus on implementation - demonstrate real changes in school, manage change and build institutional capacity to execute reforms;\n",
      "0 •\tEnsuring students grasp basic academic concepts, acquire essentials life skills and are fully equipped for college and professional life;\n",
      "0 •\tThe possible introduction of a vouchers scheme for meeting the targets for tertiary enrolment that will also encourage private participation in this sector.\n",
      "0 Targeted intervention programmes: Targeted intervention programmes will be developed to address disparities\n",
      "1 The focus will be on Dzongkhags with education indicators below the national average and hard to reach communities, children in remote areas, nomadic communities etc\n",
      "2 Targeted programmes will include activities like additional infrastructure facilities, improved teacher deployment, special incentive packages and in certain situation where cost of service delivery is very high it could include relocation of students to nearby schools with boarding facilities.\n",
      "0 Rationalization of schools: In pursuit of improving access, past Plans focused on extensive education infrastructure expansion program resulting in 553 schools and 112 Extended Classrooms (ECRs) for about 180,000 school children\n",
      "1 While facilitating access and enhancing enrolment, this strategy has led to other challenges\n",
      "2 The deployment of teachers continues to be a major issue due to the remote and difficult location of these extremely small schools\n",
      "3 Due to lack of economies of scale the difficulty of providing appropriate and adequate infrastructure facilities and resources results in multi-grade teaching learning situations which ultimately compromise the overall quality of education.\n",
      "0 The Eleventh Plan will focus on rationalization of schools with the objective of ensuring quality learning outcomes, with particular focus on children in remote rural schools.\n",
      "0 The Plan will also ensure sustainability of education service delivery by making efficient and effective use of available resources through the rationalization process keeping in mind the ground realities facing each Dzongkhag, Gewog and school.\n",
      "0 The approach would be to downgrade unsustainable primary schools with enrolment of less than 100 students which do not have scope for future increase in enrolment to extended classrooms (ECRs)\n",
      "1 Currently, there are approximately 270 primary schools with enrolment of less than 100 children\n",
      "2 With rationalization, all the primary schools would be developed to ensure that they are adequately and appropriately staffed and resourced, and the children have access to an appropriate and conducive teaching learning environment\n",
      "3 Similarly, the downgraded schools or ECRs would be developed to ensure quality learning for the remaining students, and the additional teachers made available as a result of the rationalization would be redeployed by the Dzongkhag to the schools which face teacher shortage.\n",
      "0 Professional Development for Teachers: Towards enhancing teacher morale and motivation and improving the quality of the teaching profession, Teacher Human Resource Policies and the In-Service Teacher Education and Training (INSET) Masterplan have been drawn up for implementation\n",
      "1 The Ministry of Education in collaboration with Royal Education Council will focus on promoting innovation, creativity and enterprise in education through implementation of research recommendations.\n",
      "0 Improved service delivery and private participation: To ensure sustainability, school administration and governance system will be strengthened and private participation actively pursued\n",
      "1 Tracking school rankings, teacher outcomes and improving public service delivery will enhanced through Performance Management Systems (PMS)\n",
      "2 Private participation and schemes to encourage self-financed students particularly in tertiary education will be developed.\n",
      "0 5.1.5  Key Programmes\n",
