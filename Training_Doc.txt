Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Our Nation has seen great socio-economic growth but it is more important 
that we have growth with equity. We must raise, with all our effort, the less 
fortunate so that they may, at the earliest, begin to partake in the opportunities 
brought by modernization and progress.

The government has provided education to our youth. But for the nation to 
prosper for all time, a sound education must be succeeded by access to the right 
jobs and responsibilities, so that our youth may bloom as individuals and at the 
same time serve their Nation well.

 The recent Rupee shortage is a serious problem. I feel it is a reminder that, as a 
Nation, we must exercise our traditional sense of caution and work even harder 
as we address the challenges of the time. For no matter what challenges lie 
ahead, it is only the Bhutanese citizen who can protect and safeguard Bhutan.

 

- His Majesty The King’s address to the nation during the 105th National Day 
celebrations, 17th December 2012, in Thimphu.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Eleventh Five Year Plan is the second five year plan to be implemented since 
the introduction of Democratic Constitutional Monarchy in 2008. It builds on the 
strong foundations that have been laid since the inception of planned development 
in 1961. It is guided by His Majesty the King’s Vision for Bhutan and the national 
priorities that have been consistently underscored in Royal Addresses to the nation. 
The Plan sets out an ambitious development agenda to achieve this objective and 
fulfill the current Government’s pledge of ensuring “Prosperity for All” through 
effective empowerment of the people – “Wangtse Chhirpel”. 

Chapter One presents the development planning framework, efforts towards 
operationalizing Gross National Happiness (GNH) and key milestones to be achieved 
by 2020 - Bhutan’s development planning framework continues to be guided by our 
development philosophy of GNH which encompasses the four pillars of sustainable 
and equitable socio-economic development, preservation and promotion of culture, 
conservation and sustainable utilization and management of the environment, and 
promotion of good governance. Pursuant to Article 9-2 of the Constitution, which 
directs the State “to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross 
National Happiness”, the operational aspects of GNH have been strengthened, 
most notably with the introduction of the GNH Index in 2008 and the GNH Policy 
Screening Tool in 2009. The GNH Index is based on biennial surveys and provides an 
overview of performance across 9 domains of GNH that include health, education, 
living standards, ecological diversity and resilience, good governance, psychological 
wellbeing, time use, community vitality and cultural diversity and resilience. 
Based on the 2010 GNH Index composite score of 0.743, 41 percent of Bhutanese 
were identified as happy being sufficient in 73 percent of the domains while the 
remaining 59 percent enjoyed sufficiency in 57 percent of the domains. The GNH 
Policy Screening has been used as a tool to assess the impact of new policies on GNH 
and to mainstream GNH into all new policies being formulated against twenty-two 
variables representing the 9 domains of GNH. Since its introduction, twelve policies 
related to human resources, youth, education, health and nutrition, land, natural 
resources, and industries have been approved.

A notable paradigm shift of the Eleventh Plan is the adoption of a Results Based 
Planning (RBP) framework that articulates clear outcomes and outputs that need 
to be achieved in order to realize the Eleventh Plan objective of “Self-reliance and 
Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development”. The outcomes are defined as Key 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Results Areas (KRAs) at the national, sectoral, and Dzongkhag level and categorized 
under each of the four pillars of GNH. At the national level, 16 National Key Result 
Areas (NKRAs) have been identified. At the sector and Dzongkhag levels, more 
than 300 Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) and Dzongkhag Key Result Areas (DKRAs) 
that are aligned to meet the 16 NKRAs have been identified. Furthermore, the 
performance of all government agencies towards the delivery of the NKRAs, SKRAs 
and DKRAs are measured through corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 
The KRAs are a result of extensive consultations with stakeholders’ right down to 
the grassroots level. In defining them, key aspects of the Vision 2020, Economic 
Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010), the GNH 2010 Index, the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) the SAARC Development Goals (SDGs), the Istanbul 
Programme of Action (IPoA), and the Strategy for GNH (SGNH) have also been 
taken into consideration. 

A particular significance of the Eleventh Plan is that it serves as a vital platform for 
achieving three key and related national milestones by the year 2020, which are 
namely the objectives articulated in “Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity, 
and Happiness” (Vision 2020), the objectives of self-reliance and full employment 
of the EDP 2010 and graduating from the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). 
While our socio-economic indicators show that we are making good progress 
towards achieving these milestones by 2020, with less than 7 years remaining, there 
are important challenges that need to be urgently addressed. 

Key challenges related to Vision 2020 include strengthening the various processes, 
interactions and systems of a well-functioning democracy; ensuring quality of 
social outcomes due to widening disparities and inequalities in health, education, 
income and unemployment; addressing new social challenges arising from rapid 
development and urbanization; diversification of the economy to reduce economic 
vulnerability and absorb a growing and increasingly educated labour force; 
balancing our high environmental aspirations and pressing developmental needs; 
and strengthening the capacity of key national and local government institutions. 

With regard to the EDP 2010, much remains to be done in terms of the progress of 
activities to facilitate private sector development and economic growth. A major 
challenge is to ensure that the objectives of EDP 2010 are supported by clear-cut 
strategies, policies, and support systems that harness our competitive advantage 
and address vital constraints. In this regard, the effective engagement of the 
private sector as a collaborative partner in the design of a clear roadmap for the 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

implementation of the EDP 2010 during the Eleventh Plan period is imperative and 
will be accorded high priority. 

While it is projected that Bhutan will be graduating from the list of Least Developed 
Countries (LDCs), based on the income criteria, it remains below the graduation 
threshold on the Human Assets Index (HAI) and Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI). 
The challenges confronting HAI include high malnutrition among children, a high 
under five mortality rates of 69 per 1,000 live births (AHB 2012) and a low adult 
literacy rate of 55.3 percent (BLSS 2012). EVI challenges include a small population 
size, being geographically remote and landlocked, instability of exports of goods 
and services, high vulnerability to natural disasters and instability of agricultural 
production. Improving HAI and EVI will be vital to reach the graduation threshold. 

Chapter Two reviews the demographic trends and the state of socio-economic 
development progress thus far. The first decennial Population and Housing Census 
of Bhutan (PHCB 2005) reports actual resident population of 634,982 comprising 
of 52.5 percent were males and 47.5 percent females. Of particular significance 
is the age structure, with 56 percent of the total population below the age of 24 
years. A key consideration for the current and future plans is the rapid growth in 
rural to urban migration, which was estimated at 111,770 persons in 2005. The 
rural and urban composition was 69.1 per cent and 30.9 percent respectively 
and the population density was 16 persons per square kilometer. According to 
PHCB 2005, approximately 21,894 persons or 3.4 percent of the total population 
were differently-abled, with speech, hearing, visual and mobility being the most 
common forms of impairment. The population growth rate has been on the decline 
from 3.1 per cent in 1994 to 1.3 percent in 2012 and is projected to further decline 
to 1.1 percent by 2020. Despite this declining trend, the population is expected to 
increase to 818,791 persons by 2020 and to more than a million by 2050. 

Against this background, key demographic considerations for the Eleventh Plan include 
the adoption of a National Population Policy to ensure proper demographic planning, 
harnessing the potential “demographic bonus” presented by the current demographic 
structure to create a vibrant and sustainable economy and addressing the challenges of 
a gradually ageing population, growing differently-abled persons and migratory trends.

In moving forward, it would be pertinent to take stock of key developments, 
including the progress made and challenges to be addressed, by categorizing them 
according to the four pillars of GNH. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Sustainable and Equitable Socio-economic Development: A review of the poverty 
situation provides an overview of the progress made under this first pillar of GNH. 
According to the “Poverty Analysis Report 2012”, the income poverty incidence 
has declined from 31.7 percent in 2003 to 12 percent in 2012, exceeding the Tenth 
Plan target of reducing poverty to 15 percent. Inequalities in income have also been 
reduced with the Gini-coefficient declining from 0.416 in 2003 to 0.36 over the 
same period. These gains are largely attributed to the effective implementation of 
targeted poverty reduction programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement 
Programme (REAP) and the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP), in addition 
to the broad based national socio-economic development programmes. Despite 
the progress made in the reduction of overall poverty and income inequalities, 
significant challenges remain. Notably, poverty remains predominantly a rural 
phenomenon and considerable regional disparities exist with more than half of 
the 20 Dzongkhags having poverty rates above the national average of 12 percent, 
with Lhuentse having the highest poverty rate at 31.9 percent. According to the 
Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010, the multidimensional poverty incidence in 
Bhutan was deemed to be 25.8 percent in 2010.

Against this backdrop, the Eleventh Plan will strive to further reduce the income 
poverty and multi-dimensional rates to less than 5 percent and 10 percent 
respectively by 2018. With regard to the MDGs, Bhutan has already achieved most 
of the targets and is on track to achieve the rest by 2015. However, some of the 
areas of concern such as malnutrition, female enrollment in tertiary education, 
maternal and under five mortality rates, spread of HIV/AIDS and the challenges of 
youth unemployment will need to be addressed in the Eleventh Plan. 

Preservation and Promotion of Culture: Besides the conservation of several Dzongs 
and monasteries, a number of new initiatives have been taken in the areas of 
archeology, conservation, infrastructure development, archiving and integrating 
technology to promote Dzongkha. As provided in Article 4 of the Constitution, 
which recognizes culture as an “evolving dynamic force”, emphasis is being 
placed “to strengthen and facilitate the continued evolution of traditional values 
and institutions that are sustainable as a progressive society”. In this regard, 
the promotion of cultural industries has been given high priority and notable 
achievements have been made in the promotion of local arts and crafts, nurturing 
the film and music industry and diversifying cultural tourism. In view of the multiple 
benefits it generates in terms of the promotion of culture, poverty reduction, 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

enhancing rural income and employment generation, this area will continue to 
receive high priority in the Eleventh Plan. 

Conservation and Sustainable Utilization and Management Environment: As a 
result of the traditionally high priority accorded to environmental conservation, 
Bhutan has been able to maintain forest coverage of 70.5 percent, exceeding the 
Constitutional mandate of maintaining 60 percent forest coverage at all times. 
With 51.32 percent of the country under a protected area network, Bhutan is 
host to one of the highest percentage of protected areas in the world. We have 
successfully fulfilled international obligations under the Montreal Protocol and 
have pledged to perpetually remain a net carbon sink and carbon neutral country. 

While our achievements in environmental conservation have been laudable, our 
country has been a victim of natural disasters some of which are attributed to 
climate change. In the last five years, earthquake, cyclone, windstorm, floods, 
landslides and fires have been a frequent occurrence. Ensuring a balance between 
our environmental aspirations and development needs are also increasingly 
challenging due to persistent human-wildlife conflict and the growing demand 
for natural resources. Conservation of the natural environment to maintain 
a sustainable balance between economic development and environment 
conservation and improving disaster resilience and management will therefore be 
given utmost importance in the Eleventh Plan.

Promotion of Good Governance: Significant achievements have been made in 
the promotion of good governance. Our democratic process has been further 
strengthened with the successful conduct of local government elections and 
second Parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Key constitutional 
bodies have been established and laws and regulations have been put in place 
to assist them in fulfilling their mandates. Further, several initiatives have been 
taken to strengthen public service management through civil service reforms and 
by enhancing efficiency in the delivery of public services. Transparency, financial 
accountability and control of corruption have been enhanced, through regular 
audits (600 audits in 2012) by an independently functioning Royal Audit authority; 
proactive measures by the independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), which 
include the enactment of Anti-Corruption Act 2011 and the adoption of Gift Rules 
2009 and the Asset Declaration Rule 2012; and fostering the growth of a free 
and responsible media, that includes 12 newspapers, six radio stations and two 
television news channels. Most recently the Right to Information Bill was tabled in 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

the first session of the second Parliament in September 2013. The empowerment 
of women, gender equality and the promotion of civil societies has also been an 
integral part of our efforts to promote good governance through initiatives such as 
the National Plan of Action for Gender (NPAG), 2008-2013; the Domestic Violence 
Prevention Act 2013; building capacities for women leaders; the Civil Society 
Organizations Act, 2007; and the establishment of the Civil Society Organizations 
Authority in 2009. 

In the area of child protection, major laws such as the Child Care and Protection 
Act 2011 and the Child Adoption Act of Bhutan 2012 have been enacted. Other 
legislations namely the Labour and Employment Act 2007, Marriage Act 1980, 
Inheritance Act 1980, Citizenship Act 1985 and Royal Bhutan Police Act 2009 
also address relevant child issues. Bhutan has also conducted a mapping and 
assessment of the Child Protection System in Bhutan and the developed a National 
Plan of Action for Child Protection in Bhutan. The assessment clearly indicated 
current child protection issues, challenges faced and recommendations which 
will be addressed in the Eleventh Plan in order to ensure systematic and effective 
prevention and response to child protection issues.

Notwithstanding the achievements made, our efforts in promoting good 
governance needs to be consistent and relentlessly pursued as this pillar serves as 
the fundamental basis for the other three pillars of GNH and is vital for establishing 
a vibrant democracy. In particular, strengthening and supporting institutions 
combating corruption must be accorded high priority as there is no room for 
complacency when it comes to addressing this challenge.

Chapter Three discusses the Macroeconomic situation and the outlook for 
the Eleventh Plan. Bhutan’s economy remained largely unscathed by the global 
economic downturn in 2009, primarily due to its limited integration with the 
global economy. The real GDP grew at 8 percent per annum over the last five 
years, unemployment rate was reduced from 4.2 percent in 2008 to 2.1 percent in 
2012 and poverty was reduced from 23.2 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2012. 
Although Bhutan weathered the global economic crisis, since 2011 the economy 
has been experiencing unprecedented macroeconomic policy challenges arising 
from a combination of related factors that include a surge in capital inflows for 
hydropower development, rapid credit expansion, successive build-up of current 
account deficits with India and consequently an acute and persistent shortfall in 
Rupee reserves that has yet to be effectively addressed. Remedial policy measures 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

to address the lingering Rupee shortfall has resulted in a severe credit crunch in 
the banking sector, which continues to adversely affect private investment and 
growth. Managing the rupee shortage is therefore of high priority to ensure a 
sound macroeconomic policy framework for effective implementation of the 
Eleventh Plan.

Real Sector - The economy rendered a strong performance with real growth rate 
averaging 8 percent per annum over the five years of the Tenth Plan, which was 
fueled primarily by huge Government investments, particularly in the hydropower 
sector. The lack of economic diversification has however resulted in a situation 
whereby large number of job seekers continues to be employed in the agriculture 
sector and those not willing to work in agriculture remain unemployed and poses 
significant macroeconomic challenges. This has prompted the government to initiate 
efforts towards economic diversification that will be intensified during the Plan 
period. Establishing the necessary infrastructure, creating an enabling environment 
and targeted initiatives such as Rapid Investments in Selective Enterprises (RISE) will 
form the cornerstone of the government’s diversification strategy. 

Despite a relatively high savings rate of 33.7 percent, Bhutan’s Gross Domestic 
Savings (GDS) has been inadequate to finance the significantly higher investment 
rate of 52.3 percent during the Tenth Plan. Most significantly, GDS has exhibited 
high volatility, experiencing a significant decline to -5.73 percent in the fiscal 
year 2008/09 which was followed by a growth spike to 43.17 percent in 2010/11. 
Smoothening the growth in GDS to ensure greater predictability and effective 
intermediation through the financial sector to promote private investments is 
therefore a major issue of concern. Gross fixed capital formation grew annually 
at 7.2 percent during 2001-2011 and by 12.5 percent a year since 2007. Similar to 
savings, the high investment rate also needs to be assessed in light of the declining 
returns to capital and the high volatility in investments. 

Robust growth performance of the economy, increase in disposable incomes, and 
the rapid expansion of credit have contributed to a surge in imports and successive 
current account deficits. Given limited domestic capacity, there are concerns that 
the Bhutanese economy is overheating, putting upward pressures on prices, wages 
and the real exchange rate. Inflation measured by CPI averaged about 7.7 percent 
per annum during the Tenth Plan. The year-on-year inflation rate peaked to 13.53 
percent in the 2nd quarter of 2012 and has and since then been on the decline.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

External Sector - The Tenth Plan period witnessed high volatility and a widening 
of current account deficits ranging from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 27.6 
percent in 2010/11, which culminated in an acute shortage of Indian Rupee (INR) 
reserves. While exports increased by 30.5 percent in the last five years (2008/09 - 
2012/13), imports grew by 132 percent during the same period mainly due to surge 
in hydropower related imports and the rapid expansion of credit for consumption 
related imports. A research study by UNDESA on the underlying causes of the INR 
shortfall points to a combination of factors, that include the surge in unsterilized 
hydro-related inflows which has sparked a credit multiplier effect with a strong 
import bias and thereby created a mismatch in INR inflows and outflows. The 
overall balance of payments position during the Tenth Plan has been positive, with 
successive Capital Account surpluses, averaging Nu. 15.6 billion annually, financing 
the Current Account deficits. However, close to 74 percent of the Net Capital 
inflows came in the form of external borrowings. 

The long term outlook of the external sector appears bright with the significant 
increase in export revenues expected with the commissioning of the hydro projects. 
However, caution needs to be taken and appropriate measures identified in the 
medium term to monitor external financing risks, given the alarming increase in 
short term debt instruments that come at a considerably high interest rate of 10 
percent. A key issues arising from the external imbalances is that of defending the 
Ngultrum-INR peg, which has become extremely challenging given the magnitude 
of the imbalances in recent years and the high costs of short-term borrowings to 
address them. 

Monetary Sector - The monetary policy environment in Bhutan has come under 
intense scrutiny with the emergence of a chronic INR shortfall and subsequent 
liquidity crunch in the financial system that has severely affected the economy 
since 2011. This lingering problem that has spilled over into the Eleventh Plan has 
prompted the need for monetary policy objectives to be better aligned with the 
longer term development objectives of the country. 

Of particular significance has been the high growth in broad money (M2), mainly 
due to the surge in hydro power inflows, which in turn has contributed to a rapid 
expansion of domestic credit, averaging 32.3 percent annually from 2008 to 2012. 
Most significantly, within the span of a year net domestic credit increased by 176.8 
percent, from Nu 6.8 billion in 2008 to Nu 18.9 billion in 2009. The rapid expansion 
of domestic credit has largely translated into imports, thereby exerting pressure on 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

the peg and draining of INR reserves. 

Another challenge of the monetary sector is that the banking sector has been 
characterized by high volatility in its liquidity, with a volatility coefficient of 0.76 
during the Tenth Plan. From a negative Nu. 1.1 billion in 2011, liquidity spiked to 
Nu. 4.5 billion in 2012. 

An important aspect of monetary policy in Bhutan involves the management of 
foreign reserves. Convertible currency constitutes close to 90 percent of our foreign 
reserves despite the fact the major share of our current account transactions are 
denominated in INR. The lingering INR shortfall and its effects provides a compelling 
argument for a more dynamic reserve management system that appropriately 
balances the composition of our reserves between INR and other convertible 
currencies and ensures the sustainability of the pegged exchange rate regime.

Fiscal Sector - The government’s fiscal performance has also come under scrutiny 
as excessive spending by the government has been cited as a key cause of the 
Rupee crunch. With government expenditure averaging 39 percent of nominal 
GDP and the size of recent hydro power investments being nearly equivalent to 
GDP, such concerns are not without merit. However, the government’s expenditure 
on the current account is offset to a large extent by corresponding inflows of aid 
and revenue from hydropower sales. Moreover, austerity measures that effect 
critical investments in public infrastructure and services would undermine broader 
national goals of inclusive growth and sustainable development. Nevertheless, 
various reforms to broaden the tax base and rein in unproductive and recurrent 
expenditure would help in addressing current macroeconomic imbalances. The 
ceiling for fiscal deficit during the Eleventh Plan has been set significantly lower at 
3 percent of GDP to ensure that the government limits deficit financing in view of 
the current liquidity crunch in the domestic market. 

The macroeconomic challenges that transpired during the Tenth Plan period have 
also highlighted the need for effective coordination between monetary and fiscal 
authorities. For a small open economy like Bhutan, such coordination is critical to 
ensure a stable macroeconomic environment through periodic joint assessments 
of the real, fiscal and monetary sectors; formulation of mutually reinforcing 
preventive measures; and ensuring effective remedial measures during times of 
crisis. The lingering INR crunch has brought the importance and need for such 
coordination to the fore. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Macro-economic outlook for the Eleventh Plan - Real GDP is projected to increase 
by an average of close to 12 percent per annum, with the hydropower sector driving 
most of the growth. While the projections show a very optimistic growth scenario, 
the macroeconomic challenges of recent years underscores the need to prudently 
address various issues in the real, external and monetary sectors. Given the huge 
revenue gains expected from the hydropower sector, there is also a growing 
imperative for preventive measures against the phenomenon of ‘Dutch disease”. In 
this regard, the prudent management and use of hydropower inflows towards an 
effective strategy for economic diversification, productivity enhancement through 
knowledge and skills development and employment creation will be critical. 

The external sector is expected to worsen with current account deficits averaging 
28 percent of GDP per annum over the Plan period and as high as 34.7 percent of 
GDP in 2015/16, largely on account of imports for hydropower projects. External 
borrowing will continue to be the dominant source of financing the Current 
Account deficit, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all inflows. 

The Eleventh Plan expenditure outlay is estimated to be around Nu. 213 billion of 
which 71 percent is allocated to the central agencies and 29 percent to the local 
governments. Of this, current expenditure is Nu.121 billion while capital expenditure 
is Nu.92 billion, which is an increase of 63 percent and 24 percent over that of 
the Tenth respectively. Resources are projected at Nu. 198 billion, comprising of 
domestic revenues of Nu.140 billion and external grants of Nu.58 billion. As such, 
the projected fiscal deficit is Nu. 15 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, which will mainly 
be covered through concessional borrowings. Domestic resources are projected to 
increase by 55 percent due to the commissioning of three hydro-power projects 
while grants are projected to increase by 13 percent over that of the Tenth Plan, 
mainly on account of increase in Government of India’s assistance from Nu. 34 billion 
to Nu.45 billion. The overall level of assistance from other development partners is 
projected to decline as a result of phasing out of assistance by some partners. 

The total public debt stock, 99 percent of which is external borrowings, is expected to 
increase by 135 percent in the Eleventh Plan, from Nu. 110 billion in 2013/14 to Nu.259 
billion in 2017/18. Of the total debt, 80 percent is denominated in INR on account of 
borrowings for hydropower projects, which are expected to increase by 184 percent 
from Nu. 73 billion to Nu. 206 billion. While debt has been increasing substantially and 
is expected to be 121 percent of GDP, Bhutan’s debt stock is classified as sustainable 
since 80 percent of the debt are for self-liquidating hydro-power projects. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Chapter Four introduces our socio-economic needs and aspirations for the next 
five years. It discusses the Eleventh Plan objectives, national key result areas 
and key performance indicators, strategic thrust areas and the mechanism for 
monitoring and evaluation.

The underlying objective of the Eleventh Plan is to achieve “Self-reliance and 
Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development”. Self-Reliance is defined as being 
able to meet all of our national development needs as articulated through our Five 
Year Plans by 2020. Inclusive Social Development requires reducing poverty and 
inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the quality of life of the most 
vulnerable sections of our society. Green Development means ensuring carbon 
neutral development at all times.

To realize the Eleventh Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
Economic Development”, 16 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs), key national 
outcomes and outputs, needs to be achieved over the next five years. The 16 
NKRAs, which are categorized under each of the four pillars of GNH, are defined 
as follows:

• Under the pillar of Sustainable and Equitable Socio-economic Development 
there are four NKRAs namely Sustained Economic Growth; Poverty Reduced 
and MDG Plus achieved; Food Secure and Sustained; and Full Employment. 
The achievement of these four NKRAs will be measured by corresponding Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as the annual GDP growth rates, inflation, 
poverty, enrollment, mortality, employment, cereal sufficiency target etc. 
• Under the pillar of Preservation and Promotion of Culture there are two NKRAs 
defined as Strengthened Bhutanese Identity, Social Cohesion and Harmony; and 
Indigenous Wisdom, Arts and Crafts Promoted for Sustainable Livelihood. The 
corresponding KPIs to measure progress include GNH Index, rural households 
engaged in cultural industries and jobs created. 
• Under the pillar of Conservation and Sustainable Utilization and Management 
of the Environment there are four NKRAs namely Carbon Neutral/Green and 
Climate Resilient Development; Sustainable Utilization and Management 
of Natural Resources; Water Security; and Improved Disaster Resilience and 
Management Mainstreamed. The NKRAs have corresponding KPIs to measure 
performance. Water is given special focus in the Eleventh Plan in view of its 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

importance for the basic survival of all living beings and for our hydroelectric 
projects and agriculture. It has also been one of the major difficulties faced 
by the Dzongkhags and communities and therefore an ambitious target of 
ensuring 24 hours water supply has been set. 
• Under the pillar Promotion of Good Governance there are six NKRAs covering 
Improved Public Service Delivery; Democracy and Governance Strengthened; 
Gender Friendly Environment for Women’s Participation; Corruption Reduced; 
Safe Society; and Needs of Vulnerable Group Addressed. The KPIs such 
as reducing turnaround time for Government to Citizen, Government to 
Business and Government to Government services; monitoring government 
performance; drafting legislation to ensure quota for women in elected offices; 
reducing female unemployment; implementation of national anti-corruption 
strategy; and reducing crime per 1,000 population will be the basis for tracking 
progress towards these NKRAs. 


The main strategic thrust to achieve the national outcomes and outputs will be on 
i) inclusive social development, ii) accelerated green economic development and 
iii) strategic infrastructure development. 

• Inclusive social development which will focus on further reducing income and 
multidimensional poverty, address emerging social issues and improve social 
outcomes in health and education sectors. The targeted key interventions 
include the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) to address 
extreme rural poverty at village and community levels; the National 
Rehabilitation Programme (NRP) to enhance the productive asset base of 
marginalized households; the Local Government Empowerment Programme 
(LGEP) to enhance decision making capacity and improve service delivery 
through provision of essential equipment, machinery and Nu. 2 million per year 
per Gewog; special programme for vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, 
differently-abled persons, and youth; and targeted health and education 
interventions to reach the unreached for Dzongkhags with poor health and 
education outcomes. 
• Green Accelerated Economic Development which will focus on economic 
diversification through the development of non-hydropower sectors and by 
fostering the growth of a dynamic private sector that catalyzes a transition to a 
green economy. Key interventions include the Economic Stimulus Programme 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

to address the present credit crunch and make finances available for productive 
sectors; Rapid Investment in Selected Enterprises (RISE) Programme, the 
flagship programme to accelerate economic growth and achieve the objective 
of self reliance, will target an end-to-end development of non-hydro sectors 
such as tourism, agro-processing, construction, small and cottage industries 
including cultural industries and manufacturing and mining; optimizing 
opportunities of accelerated hydropower development to enhance local trade 
and commerce, participation of local private sector and workforce and aligning 
corporate social responsibilities of hydropower projects with local needs and 
plans; enabling environment through simplification of the policy and regulatory 
framework and facilitating vital infrastructure development such as surface 
and air transport, dry ports and industrial estates.
• Strategic Infrastructure Development which will focus on development of 
critical infrastructure to complement the efforts under the above two thrust 
areas and to achieve the Eleventh Plan objectives. The investments will 
primarily be in urban, transport, ICT, energy, economic, social and cultural 
infrastructure. These include the development of 2 regional hubs and 
infrastructure facilities and services in Dzongkhag headquarters and towns; 
expansion and improvement of road and air connectivity; expansion of ICT 
infrastructure including a national data centre, government intranet system, 
national broadband master-plan and facilities for G2C, G2G and G2B services; 
expansion of energy infrastructure through the accelerated development of 
10,000 MW of hydropower, construction of transmission lines and substations 
and expansion of rural electrification; the development of dry ports in 
Phuentsholing and Jigmeling or Nanglam and industrial parks in Mongar, 
Samtse, Samdrup Jongkhar and Sarpang; and construction of educational and 
health infrastructure and renovation/construction of Dzongs.


The chapter concludes with discussion on the proposed monitoring and elevation 
system of the Eleventh Plan. The monitoring and evaluation will be based on 
the National Monitoring and Evaluation System (NMES) which comprises the 
monitoring and evaluation institutional set-up and procedures and the Planning 
& Monitoring system (PlaMS). The Eleventh Plan will give particular emphasis to 
institutionalizing the evaluation of programmes and projects which are currently 
limited to those that are donor funded. Further, the Mid-Term Review of the 
Eleventh Plan will assess progress in the implementation of the Plan and make 
necessary adjustments in policies, programmes and projects and allocation of 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

resources. Two Round Table Meetings (RTM) will be held; one during the inception 
of the Eleventh Plan to sensitize development partners on the priorities and policies 
and the other towards the middle of the Plan to share progress in implementation 
of the Plan. Bilateral consultations, programme and project specific reviews, and 
monitoring and evaluation meetings will be held between the Royal Government 
and development partners.

Chapter Five presents the Central Plans and the Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) 
with corresponding KPIs. 

Education Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector include last mile 
access to education, disparities in education outcomes at the local levels and 
catering to the special needs of children with disabilities. A major issue of concern 
is the relevance and quality of education. Although improvements in efficiency 
indicators indicate that the quality of education has improved over the years, 
a number of reports reveal that an increasing numbers of students, including 
graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are inadequately prepared 
to enter the workforce, which has resulted in a paradoxical situation of relatively 
high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills shortage at the same time. 
Evidently, changing realities, both domestic and external, are placing a demand on 
our education system to achieve higher standards at a scale that has never been 
met or required before. 

According to Royal Education Council’s (REC) research study on the quality of 
education in Bhutan, the overall trend indicates that there is a big gap between the 
current and the desired state in the quality of outcomes and processes, with under-
prepared teachers, lack of appropriate curricular resources, and poor instructional 
leadership and in-service training as the three critical reasons for the persistence of 
ineffective classroom practices across schools and arguably also across vocational 
and tertiary education institutions. A major challenge, which is also related to the 
above, is the sustainability of financing the expenditure of the education sector. 

The main objectives of the education sector in the Eleventh Plan are to ensure 
quality of education service delivery; ensure education sustainability; and achieve 
MDG plus. Strategies include targeted intervention programmes, rationalization of 
schools through a consolidation programme; enhancing professional development 
for teachers; improved service delivery and promoting private participation. 

Health Sector: The key issues and challenge of this sector include delivering quality 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

health care; acute shortage of all categories of health personnel against the 
growing need to expand health services; growing incidence of non-communicable 
diseases; spread of HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and outbreaks of Neglected Tropical 
Diseases (NTDs); maternal and child health; nutrition; and sustainable healthcare 
financing. The main objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to improve 
access to quality and equitable health services, strengthen preventive, promotive, 
rehabilitative and palliative health services and promote efficiency and effectiveness 
in financing and delivery of health services. Strategies to achieve these objectives 
include greater emphasis on preventive and promotional measures; human 
resources development; sustainable health financing; standardization of eHealth 
and interoperability; and consolidation of health infrastructure.

Human Resource Development & Management: The key issues and challenges of 
this sector are the high percentage of civil servants not meeting the minimum 
qualification criteria; mismatch between skills and jobs available; retention of civil 
servants; and unsustainable growth in the size of civil service. To address these 
challenges, strategies will focus on creating a pool of skilled manpower aligned to 
meet the objectives of EDP 2010, with an emphasis on addressing the acute shortage 
of skilled professionals such as doctors, educationists, engineers, architects and ICT 
specialists; strengthening human resource management systems and processes to 
enhance performance, efficiency and motivation of the civil servants; review and 
ensure full implementation of National Human Resource Development Policy 2010 
to address issues of coordination and synergies. 

Employment: Although the unemployment rate has declined from to 4.2 percent 
in 2008 to 2.1 percent in 2012, major challenges with regard to the quality of 
employment remain. There is also a lack of synergy between the education system 
and manpower needs given the shortage of skilled manpower across sectors, and 
a mismatch of employee aspirations and jobs available given significant import of 
labor, particularly in the construction sector. 

In the Eleventh Plan, 82,000 new jobs need to be created for approximately 120,000 
job seekers, to achieve the target of full employment – defined as unemployment 
of 2.5 percent. The main objective of this sector is to achieve full and productive 
employment. Strategies to achieve this objective include implementation of the 
Rapid Investments in Selected Enterprises (RISE) programme and strengthening 
linkages between the education system and manpower needs of the country to 
address the mismatch of skills and aspirations. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) Sector: The key issues and challenges of this 
sector are loss of agriculture land, declining productivity, human wildlife conflict, 
shortage of farm labourers and irrigation facilities, pest and disease management 
and weak post harvest management and facilities. The key objectives of this sector 
in the Eleventh Plan are to enhance food and nutrition security; improve rural 
livelihood; accelerate and sustain RNR sector growth; and promote sustainable 
management and utilization of natural resources. The strategies to achieve these 
objectives include targeted and commodity focused interventions; foster transition 
from subsistence to commercial agriculture; ensure an enabling environment; and 
promote private sector participation and contract farming. 

Tourism Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector include accessibility, 
seasonality, the lack of regional spread and product diversification, shortage of 
skilled manpower in the form of trained guides, skilled workers in hospitality sector, 
qualified and experienced professionals in product development, destination 
marketing and other tourism-related services. The sector is still largely dependent 
on international tour operators for arrivals. The main objective of this sector in the 
Eleventh Plan is to continue promoting Bhutan as a high value low impact tourist 
destination. The key strategy will be to promote Bhutan as an exclusive destination 
based on high level of services, diversified tourism products and improved tourism 
infrastructure facilities. The focus will be on regional spread, addressing seasonality 
issues and community participation. 

Trade, Industries & Mines Sector: The key issue in terms of trade is the lack of product 
diversification of our exports, with about 80 percent of total exports consisting 
of electricity, mineral products and base metal, which are all highly vulnerable. 
Diversification of our exports into agricultural and non-mineral and non-metal 
products requires substantial investments. In terms of industries, about 85 percent 
of Bhutanese industries are small and micro industries, which are constrained by 
lack of access to capital, technology, markets and labour resulting in low volume, 
high cost and inferior quality products. The mining sector suffers from the absence 
of a clear mineral development policy and human resource constraints. The main 
objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are to create an enabling environment 
for private sector development and stimulating export growth; ensure green and 
sustainable development of SME’s; ensure sustainable geo-scientific investigation 
and mineral development; and prevent and reduce risks associated with geo-hazards. 
Strategies to achieve these objectives include a coordinated implementation of 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

the Economic Development Policy 2010, the implementation of Rapid Investment 
in Selected Sector (RISE) Programme and creation of an enabling environment 
through infrastructure investments, and addressing issues such as excise refunds, 
access to finance particularly for cottage, small and medium industries, reduction 
in turn-around-time for Government to Business (G2B) services specially in terms of 
government clearances/ approvals, and development of capital markets.

Energy sector: This sector is the lynchpin of our economy, accounting for about 
18 percent of total revenues and about 20 percent of GDP. The key issues and 
challenges of this sector include high upfront investment costs for hydro-power 
projects, which pose significant challenges in terms of raising financing for the 
project; maintaining the balance between the needs of domestic consumption and 
export earnings and the demand by households and industries; the viability of the 
cost of electricity generation and supply and current tariff levels; infrastructure 
development; system reinforcement; building human resource capacity; and GLoF 
and hydrological risks. The main objectives of this sector in the Eleventh Plan are 
to increase energy security and the sector’s contribution to revenue, economic 
growth and employment and to strengthen hydrometeorology data to facilitate 
reliable weather, GLoF and water related forecasting. The key strategies to achieve 
these objectives are strengthening of institutional and human capacity of the 
sector, rural electrification, investment in transmission lines and formulation of 
energy allocation policy to ensure sustainable and optimum utilization of additional 
firm power and to enhance energy security and reduce dependency on fossil fuel 
by promoting other forms of alternate renewable energy.

Information Communication & Technology and Media Sector: The key issues and 
challenges of this sector include the significantly higher telecommunication tariffs 
than those in the region which negates the other comparative advantages; lack of 
international redundancy and a shortage of qualified ICT professionals, all of which 
pose a challenge for Bhutan to serve as a potential hub for ICT and ICT enabled 
services. The main objectives of this sector are to promote Bhutanese information 
society, strengthen good governance, enhance economic development and 
develop a responsible, vibrant and creative information and media industry. The 
main strategies to achieve these objectives are the implementation of the e-Gov 
Master Plan, capacity building and expansion of ICT infrastructure. Opportunities 
to tap mobile technology to provide public services will be actively explored. 

Transport Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector are enhancing the 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

capacity of Paro airport to serve double the number of passengers, flights and 
air cargo; enhancing road safety with the number of vehicles having doubled in 
the last five years and motor vehicles accidents increasing from 696 in 2005 to 
1,730 in 2011. The main objective of this sector in the Eleventh Plan will be to 
increase access to safe, reliable, affordable, eco-friendly and convenient transport 
services. Strategies to achieve this objective include strengthening the capacity 
of Paro International Airport, improving the three domestic airports, expansion 
of air services to and from international destinations, increasing access to 
public transportation in rural areas and eco-friendly mass public transportation 
services in urban areas, and improving driver licensing procedures, motor vehicle 
fitness standards, public safety awareness campaigns and equipping road safety 
authorities with necessary equipments and tools to monitor road safety.

Roads & Bridges Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector are road safety 
with some highways constructed in the early 1960s and 70s when vehicular traffic 
was significantly lower and on account of difficult geographical terrain; quality of 
construction and high transport costs; and financial sustainability of maintaining the 
vast network of road constructed and blacktopping of unpaved roads. The two main 
objectives of this sector are to increase efficiency and reliability of road infrastructure 
to facilitate economic development and strengthen national security and ensure 
sustainability through mechanization and greater private sector participation. 
Strategies include institutional and human resource development to strengthen the 
capacity of road sector to plan, design, build and maintain road network; expansion 
of the national highway backbone grid, improvement of road specifications and 
standards; geometric improvements and regular maintenance; exploring tunneling 
of certain stretches of the highways; and involvement of the private sector in the 
maintenance of roads to ensure financial sustainability. 

Construction: The key issues and challenges of this sector are low demand for 
construction sector jobs due to low wages, lack of job security, and low levels 
of mechanization and limited design, planning and supervision capability due 
to shortage of qualified professionals and a lack of basic tools and technology 
which result in relatively high costs of construction, poor quality of work, and high 
maintenance costs. The main objective of this sector in the Eleventh Plan is to 
enhance the quality of construction industry through the introduction of new energy 
efficient technology, mechanization and human resource development. Strategies 
to achieve this objective include training and capacity building of professionals 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

in the construction sector, consolidation of contract packages, promotion of 
construction mechanization and use of local construction materials, special service 
conditions to make construction jobs attractive, and aligning vocational training 
programmes to the needs of construction industry. 

Human Settlement and Housing Sector: The key issues and challenges of this sector 
are a lack of clear legislation and polices in human settlement planning, gaps in inter-
sectoral coordination; limited human resource capacity, both in terms of numbers 
and skills; and housing shortages given that the National Housing Development 
Corporation’s housing stock is 1,122 units. The shortages are particularly severe in 
Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gasa, Lhuentse and Samdrup Jongkhar, where for example, 
many Bhutanese in Phuentsholing are compelled to live across the border while 
in Gasa and Lhuentse civil servants are living in temporary makeshift huts. While 
increasing the housing stock is imperative, making it affordable, particularly for the 
low and middle income group, is a major challenge. The main objectives of this sector 
are to ensure balanced and sustainable development of human settlements; improve 
quality of urban infrastructure and services; and provide safe, aesthetic, adequate 
and affordable housing. Strategies to achieve these objectives include planned 
and sustainable development of human settlements through new legislations and 
policies and improved rules and regulations; accelerated development of valley plans, 
regional hub plans and rural-urban development plans in order to contain rural urban 
migration; capacity building of engineers, architects and planners; adoption of new 
technologies and design innovation to reduce the cost of construction while ensuring 
quality; increase low income housing for rental; and promotion of home ownership. 

Emerging Social Challenges: With rapid development, Bhutan is confronted 
with new social issues such as those related to youth, senior citizens, single 
parents, orphans, differently-abled persons, domestic violence and crime. The 
lack of a central agency that is responsible for coordinating efforts poses a major 
challenge to effectively address these emerging issues. Current efforts that are 
being undertaken are based on the initiative of various sectors and civil society 
organizations and associations and many of these organizations are constrained by 
lack of technical and financial resources. There is also a paucity of studies, baseline 
data, and surveys to clearly ascertain the situation and recommend appropriate 
interventions. The main objective to address emerging social challenges will be 
to ensure access to integrated critical services covering health, education, justice 
and protection, counselling, welfare and rehabilitation. Strategies will include 
the conduct of detailed studies on emerging social issues to enable appropriate 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

intervention programmes and strengthened partnerships with CSOs. 

Sports: The lack of a focused and coherent strategy, despite more than three 
decades since the establishment of the National Sports Association and the Bhutan 
Olympic Committee (BOC), has been a major issue for the development of sports in 
Bhutan. The sector is also challenged by the lack of infrastructure facilities, human 
resources capacity and financial sustainability. The main objectives of this sector 
in the Eleventh Plan are to establish a representative and organized sport system 
that fosters excellence in sports and promotes recreation throughout the country; 
promotes a vibrant sporting culture that contributes to addressing youth issues, 
lifestyle related diseases, employment, community cohesiveness and international 
image of the country. The main strategy will be the implementation of the “Strategic 
Vision and Road Map for Development of Sports in Bhutan” by the BOC. 

Preservation and Promotion of Culture: The Eleventh Plan takes cognizance of 
culture as an “evolving dynamic force” and the need “to strengthen and facilitate 
the continued evolution of traditional values and institutions that are sustainable 
as a progressive society”1. As such, the preservation and promotion of culture 
is accorded priority not just for strengthening our identity but is an economic 
imperative to address poverty through the development of cultural industries. 

A major issue and challenge to the preservation and promotion of culture is 
related to keeping the age old local customs and traditions alive with many of the 
younger generation either not keen or not having the required skills to continue 
these traditions, with many having left their villages, a consequence of increasing 
rural-urban migration trend. The tangible cultural properties such as Dzongs and 
Lhakangs are under threat of natural and manmade disasters such as earthquakes, 
windstorms, landslides, vandalism and fire and conserving and restoring these 
monuments require substantial resources. The promotion of cultural industries 
which has potential and is vital for poverty alleviation is confronted with challenges 
arising from access to finance, poor economy of scale, quality of products and access 
to markets. 

The main objectives of this sector are to strengthen national identity, social cohesion 
and harmony; and promote indigenous wisdom, arts and crafts for sustainable 
livelihood. Key strategies to achieve these objectives are strengthening institutional 
capacity for inventory and documentation of oral traditions, history, arts, living 

1Article 4 of the Constitution



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

social practices, Tshechus, rituals and festivals; host regular cultural exhibitions and 
colloquiums; conservation and restoration of cultural heritage sites, including the 
incorporation of disaster resilient measures; capacity development for research 
and documentation of the performing arts and conservation and restoration 
measures through trainings/workshops; archival surveys and documentation; and 
facilitating the growth of cultural industries through access to finance, product 
development support, raw material banks, promotion of craft clusters, craft 
bazaars and business incubators. 
expressions, and architectural knowledge; preservation and promotion of arts, 

Conservation of Environment - Conservation of environment is an integral part of 
our development strategy to ensure that socio-economic development efforts do 
not come at the cost of our natural environment. Since 2009, all new policies 
introduced are subject to a GNH Policy Screening to assess the impact of a new 
policy on GNH. The GNH Policy Screening tool comprise twenty two variables of 
which three are on environment, namely water and air pollution, land degradation 
and bio-diversity health. Due to the rapid pace of socio-economic development, 
land degradation, air pollution, and solid waste management are major issues and 
challenges facing this sector. However, ensuring water security is currently the 
most significant issue facing this sector and has been identified as one of the 16 
National Key Result Areas to be achieved over the Eleventh Plan period. Water is 
a vital natural resource for our basic survival as well as for our economy given our 
high dependence on agriculture and hydropower. Despite having one of the world’s 
highest per capita availability of water, water shortage is a major issue in both rural 
and urban communities. In 2011, electricity sector experienced negative growth 
mainly due to hydrological risk. The main objectives of the environment sector are 
to ensure carbon neutral and climate resilient development, enhance sustainable 
utilization and management of natural resources and enhance water security. Key 
strategies to achieve these objectives include implementation of the National 
Strategy and Action Plan for Low Carbon Development 2012; mainstreaming of 
environment across all sectoral and local government programmes and projects; 
implementation of the Integrated Water Resource Management Plan; and 
addressing water security. 

Good Governance - Being vital for sustainable and equitable socio-economic 
development, the Eleventh Plan will continue to give emphasis to good governance 
by strengthening democracy, improving public service delivery, promoting gender 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

equality, curbing corruption, enhancing safety and addressing the needs of the 
vulnerable groups. The key issues and challenges facing this sector are lack of 
institutional and human capacity, particularly at the local government level; growth 
in quantity and complexity of the policy and regulatory environment; gender related 
issues such as relatively high female unemployment, and low female enrollment 
in tertiary education, which are a concern particularly in terms of achievement of 
the MDGs; and sustaining the progress made in combating corruption. The main 
objectives under this pillar will be to further improve public service delivery and 
strengthen democracy and good governance. Key strategies to achieve these 
objectives include the implementation of the Government Performance Management 
System, National Anti-corruption Strategy, improving public service delivery through 
G2C, G2B and G2G services, and capacity building and awareness campaigns to 
enhance transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in governance. 

Chapter Six discusses the Local Government Plans comprising of 20 Dzongkhags 
and 4 Thromdes, and the Dzongkhag Key Result Areas and Thromde Key Result 
Areas with corresponding KPIs. 

Since the inception of Fifth Plan in 1981, the Royal Government has actively pursued 
a proactive decentralization policy to promote participatory development, which 
culminated in the introduction of a Gewog-based planning approach in the Ninth 
Plan, whereby Local Governments (LG) formulated their Five Year Plans based on 
priorities identified by communities at the Gewog level. To further strengthen the 
decentralization process, a formula based rationalized Annual Grants System (AGS) 
using population, poverty and area as the criteria and that takes into account 
the principles of equity, transparency and objectivity was introduced during the 
Tenth Plan. A key objective of the AGS was to provide predictability of resource 
availability to local governments and flexibility in its use. 

In addition to the SKRAs, Dzongkhag Key Results Areas (DKRAs) with corresponding 
KPIs have been defined for each Dzongkhag based on the four pillars of GNH. The 
structure of the local government plans, whereby the DKRAs and strategies are 
anchored to the circumstances of each Dzongkhag, also emphasizes the need for a 
common but differentiated approach to development. The high priority accorded to 
local government plans in the Eleventh Plan is evident from the formula based annual 
grants of Nu. 15 billion for local government plans, which is an increase of 25 percent 
over Tenth Plan outlay, Nu. 5 billion for local government empowerment programme 
and Nu. 5 billion allocated to four Thromdes. In total, the local governments receive 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

direct capital allocation of Nu. 25 billion or about 28 percent of the total capital 
outlay. In addition, resources for local government education activities and targeted 
poverty intervention programmes are provided through central government budget. 

In order to enhance the usefulness and relevance of the AGS, both in terms of 
viability and sustainability, the formula for resource allocation to local governments 
has been revised for the Eleventh Plan with introduction of two additional criteria, 
namely Multidimensional Poverty Index2 (MPI) and Transport Cost Index3 (TCI). 
To ensure equity, efficiency, accountability and transparency for the realization of 
the Eleventh Plan goal and outcomes, the responsibilities among Central agencies, 
Class “A” Thromdes, Dzongkhags and Gewogs have been clearly delineated based 
on the division of responsibilities framework, which is guided by the ‘principle of 
subsidiarity’. To further strengthen local governments, reforms to create incentives 
for local governments to enhance revenues from commercial activities in their 
Dzongkhags will also be undertaken as a priority.

The Dzongkhags will pursue strategies that will contribute to reduction in 
multidimensional poverty. The strategies to enhance household incomes will include 
increasing agriculture, livestock and non-wood forest productivity, developing tourism 
potential and cottage, small and medium industries. The Dzongkhags will work in 
close collaboration with the central agencies to further improve health and education 
outcome. To accelerate poverty reduction at community and household levels, targeted 
poverty intervention programmes such as Rural Economy Advancement Programme 
(REAP) and National Rehabilitation Programmes will be implemented. 

The Thromdes will focus on development of sustainable and highly livable urban 
towns. The preparation of structural and local area plans for core areas will be prioritized 
to prevent unplanned development. The issues of drinking water shortage 
will be addressed by exploring and investing in construction of bore wells, ground 
water exploration and water reservoir to ensure 24 hours of adequate and reliable 
supply of clean drinking water. Further, the Thromdes will ensure urban roads, 
street lights, recreational parks, sports facilities, sewerage and waste management 
system etc are constructed and improved to enhance safety and promote community 
vitality. High priority will also be accorded to initiatives that will enhance their 
revenues.

1.1 Introduction


The Eleventh Five Year Plan builds on the strong foundations we have laid since 
the inception of planned development in 1961. Its goals, objectives and strategies 
are guided by His Majesty the King’s Vision for Bhutan and the national priorities 
that have been consistently underscored in Royal Addresses on various occasions 
to the nation. The development planning framework is based on our development 
philosophy of Gross National Happiness.

The Plan also sets out an ambitious development agenda which is based on the 
government’s ideology of “Prosperity for All” to be achieved by empowering 
people with liberty, equality and prosperity through the devolution of power and 
authority from the centre to the people – “Wangtse Chhirpel”. 

The documentations for the Eleventh Plan are as follows:

• Volume I: Main Document – Volume I discusses the current socio-
economic development progress, the key challenges and opportunities 
and the outlook for the Eleventh Plan. The Eleventh Plan goals, objectives, 
overall strategies, fiscal framework, and sectoral and local government 
objectives and strategies are presented in Volume I. 
• Volume II: Central Government Programme Profiles – Volume II provides 
an overview of the major programmes to be implemented by central 
agencies. It includes information on the programmes, objectives, costs, 
activities, etc.
• Volume III: Local Government Programme Profiles – Volume III provides 
an overview of programmes to be implemented by the local governments 
– 20 Dzongkhags, 205 Gewogs and 4 Thromdes. It includes information on 
the programmes, objectives, costs, activities, etc.


1.2 Development Planning Framework 


Bhutan’s development planning framework continues to be guided by our 
development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH) which was conceived 
by the Fourth King His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972. GNH broadly 
encompasses four pillars, which are namely i) sustainable and equitable socio-

01

BACKGROUND



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

economic development, ii) preservation and promotion of culture, iii) conservation 
and sustainable utilization and management of the environment, and iv) promotion 
of good governance. 

1.2.1 Result Based Planning


The Plan is based on the Results Based Planning (RBP) framework. The RBP 
framework articulates the outcomes and outputs that need to be achieved over 
the next five years in order to achieve the Eleventh Plan objective of “Self-reliance 
and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development”. 

The outcomes and outputs, defined as Key Result Areas, have been identified at 
the National, Sectoral, Dzongkhag, Thromdes and Gewog levels. The result areas 
were identified through a two year process of extensive consultation involving 
all relevant stakeholders, both at the central and local levels, and attempts to 
capture the many needs and aspirations of the nation and its people. Further, 
the Constitution of Bhutan, the national long term goals envisioned in the Vision 
2020, the Economic Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010), the GNH 2010 Index, 
Bhutan’s progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SAARC 
Development Goals (SDGs), Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA), international, 
regional and national commitments on environment, population and development, 
women and children and the Strategy for GNH (SGNH) etc have all been taken into 
consideration while defining the key result areas.

At the national level, there are 16 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs) which needs 
to be achieved over the next five years to realize the Eleventh Plan objective. 
All central ministries, constitutional bodies, autonomous agencies, Dzongkhags, 
Thromdes and Gewogs contribute to, through their respective sectors, Dzongkhag, 
Thromde and Gewog Key Result Areas. The performance of the central and 
local government agencies towards delivery of the national key result areas are 
measured through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) consisting of baselines and 
targets.

1.2.2 Plan Preparation


The preparation of the Eleventh Plan started in May 2011 in two stages. The 
first stage was the drafting of “Guideline for Preparation of the Eleventh Plan4”. 
The purpose of the guideline was to provide a basis for the central and local 
government agencies to formulate their respective sectoral/local government 
Plans. The guideline highlights the key challenges, national objective, strategies, 
key result areas and the key performance indicators. The guideline was prepared 
in consultation with all relevant stakeholders and circulated in March 2012. 

The second stage, which commenced in April 2012, was the formulation of central 
and local government plans by the respective agencies. The Gewog Plans for 205 
Gewogs were planned and prioritized by Gewog Tshogde - GT (Block Development 
Committee) and Dzongkhag Plans for 20 Dzongkhags by Dzongkhag Tshogdu- DT 
(District Development Committee) within the resource envelop indicated for the 
local governments.

1.3 Operationalizing Gross National Happiness 


The key efforts undertaken by the government towards operationalizing GNH are the 
introduction of the GNH Index in 2008 and the GNH Policy Screening Tool in 2009. 

1.3.1 GNH Index


While GNH has been the guiding principle for Bhutan’s socio-economic development 
over the last four decades, it was only in 2008 that efforts to track Bhutan’s progress 
towards maximizing happiness were initiated with the introduction of GNH Index5. 
The main purpose of developing the GNH Index was to ensure that the policies and 
programmes pursued, following the changes in the system of governance, continued 
to be consistent with GNH. It was also to ensure that the Constitutional requirement 
under Article 9-2 which directs the State “to promote those conditions that will 
enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness” would be fulfilled. 

The GNH Index has been developed based on biennial surveys of 2008 and 2010. 

The 2010 GNH Index comprises of 9 domains, 33 indicators and 124 variables. Of 
the 9 domains, 5 represent the conventional indicators of health, education, living 
standards, ecological diversity and resilience and good governance which are used 
by most countries to measure development. The 4 new indicators that attempt to 
measure the intangible needs of an individual and society include psychological 
wellbeing; time use; community vitality; and cultural diversity and resilience. Each 
domain is measured based on 2-4 indicators, as illustrated in Table 1.1.

The GNH Index provides an overview of performance across the 9 domains of 
GNH. The 2010 GNH Index of 0.743 shows that overall 41 percent of Bhutanese 
are identified as happy as they enjoyed sufficiency in 73 percent of the domains 
while the remaining 59 percent enjoyed sufficiency in 57 percent of the domains 
on an average. Financial security, good health and family relationships were the 
top three sources of happiness at the national level as per the GNH 2010 Survey.

The key findings of 2010 GNH Survey as per the Short Guide to GNH Index, Centre 
for Bhutan Studies were as follows.

• Men were happier than women on average.
• Of the nine domains, Bhutanese had the most sufficiency in health, followed 
by ecology, psychological wellbeing, and community vitality.
• 50 percent of people were happy in urban areas; in rural areas it was 37 percent. 
Urban areas did better in health, living standards and education. Rural areas did 
better in community vitality, cultural resilience, and good governance.
• Happiness was higher among people with primary education or above than 
among those with no formal education, but higher education did not affect 
GNH very much.

• The happiest people by occupation were civil servants, monks/nuns, and 
GYT/DYT members. Unemployed were happier than corporate employees, 
housewives, farmers or the national work force.
• Unmarried people and young people were among the happiest.
• The happiest Dzongkhags included Paro, Sarpang, Dagana, Haa, Thimphu and 
Gasa while Samdrup Jongkhar and Lhuentse were among the less happier 
Dzongkhags
• In terms of numbers, the highest number of happy people lived in Thimphu 
and Chukha – as do the highest number of unhappy people!
• Thimphu was better in education and living standards than other Dzongkhags, 
but worse in community vitality.
• Financial Security was ranked the most important source for individual happiness.
1.3.2 GNH Policy Screening 


The GNH policy screening6 is a tool that is used to assess the impact of introducing 
new policies on GNH and to mainstream GNH into all new policies being 
formulated. Policies are screened against twenty-two variables representing the 
9 GNH domains. Each screening question has a 4-pointer scale ranging from 1 to 
4, 1 being negative and 4 positive. Below is an example under the psychological 
wellbeing domain:

The GNH screening of each policy is carried out by the proponent sector and the 
GNHC Secretariat involving a minimum of 10-15 individuals representing diverse 
professions/fields. The threshold for a policy to be GNH favourable is 66 (22 
variables*neutral score of 3).

1.4 Key Development Milestones 


The Eleventh Plan will also be the basis for achieving the three key and related 
milestones by the year 2020: i) the goals and objectives articulated in “Bhutan 2020: 
A Vision for Peace, Prosperity, and Happiness”, ii) the objectives of self-reliance and 
full employment of the Economic Development Policy 2010 and iii) graduating from 
the list of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). While our socio-economic indicators 
show that we are making good progress towards achieving these milestones, there 
are important challenges that need to be urgently addressed. With just seven 
years left for 2020, the success of the Eleventh Plan will be critical in our efforts to 
achieve these milestones.

1.4.1 Bhutan 2020 - A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness 


Since its launch in the year 2000, “Bhutan 2020 – A Vision for Peace, Prosperity 
and Happiness” formed the basis for the formulation and implementation of 
successive Five Year Plans. The Vision Statement underscores the need “to ensure 
the future independence, sovereignty and security of our nation-state” as a 
precondition for the fulfillment of the hopes and aspirations of our nation and 
people. Furthermore, it provides six guiding principles in the pursuit of this goal: 
maintenance and strengthening of our distinct Bhutanese identity; maintenance 
of unity and harmony; ensuring stability; promoting self-reliance; ensuring that 
development is sustainable; and demonstrating flexibility and capacity to adapt to 
change. 

As we approach 2020, a brief review of where we are today and what remains to be 
done over the next seven years was assessed on the basis of the Vision Statement’s 
five thematic headings encompassing: our nation, our people, our economy, our 
environment and our institutions. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Our Nation – Much has been achieved towards strengthening the peace, security 
and prosperity of our nation. Today, Bhutan is a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy 
with a democratically elected parliament and government. State Principles 
based on which the country will be governed, the powers and responsibilities of 
various authorities and the fundamental rights and duties of its people are clearly 
articulated in a written Constitution. The transition was overseen by His Majesty 
the King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who then assumed the role of the 
Head of State from 2008. The King is the symbol of unity of the Kingdom and 
the people of Bhutan, whose Vision and guidance on national priorities serve as 
beacons for the future direction of our nation.

While much has been achieved towards strengthening our nation’s independence, 
security and sovereignty, there are many new challenges for a young democracy. 
The cornucopia of processes, interactions and systems of a well functioning 
democracy has to be learnt gradually through experience. This needs to be 
complemented by education and awareness, promotion of female participation 
in governance, capacity building of our legislators, strengthening of the media and 
other such efforts. 

Our People – The quality of life and the overall socio-economic status of our people 
has improved significantly. Poverty has been reduced from 31 percent in 2003 to 
12 percent in 2012. Our primary school enrollment rates have increased from 72 
percent in 19997 to near 100 percent. Life expectancy has increased from 66 years 
in 1999 to 68 years and population growth rates have stabilized around 1.3 percent 
from a high of 3.1 percent in 1994. The development concept of GNH has been 
introduced into the core of our education system. It strives to foster wholesome 
development of our children so that they are better prepared to appreciate the 
importance of moral and ethical choices in their lives. A full range of educational 
institutions for a knowledge based society have been established and more are in 
pipeline. 

However, the quality of social outcomes remains a challenge with disparities 
and inequalities at local levels. Some Dzongkhags have poverty levels of below 
0.5 percent while others have a high of 31.9 percent8. Similarly disparities are 
noted in health and education outcomes. Unemployment is low at 2.1 percent 
in 2012 but youth and female unemployment rates remain comparatively high. 
With development, Bhutan is also confronted, particularly in major urban towns, 

01

BACKGROUND

8Poverty Analysis 2012, NSB.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

with new social challenges related to youth issues, domestic violence, single parent 
households, abandoned children, a growing number of senior citizens without 
adequate family support, and crime. These issues need to be urgently looked into 
and addressed for our people to be self-confident, live in harmony and unity, and 
share a common sense of purpose and destiny. 

Our Economy – The GDP per-capita has increased from USD 1,387 in 2006 to 
USD 2,590 in 2011. The economy has grown at an average of 7-8 percent per 
annum, unemployment rates are below 3 percent and domestic revenue is able 
to cover about 65 percent of our annual budgetary requirements. We will have 
harnessed 4,546 MW of hydropower by 2018 from the present levels of 1,488 
MW, thereby exceeding the Vision 2020 target of 3,000 MW by 2017. By 2020, the 
second transnational highway will be completed with the initiation of construction 
of southern east-west highway and 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity generation 
capacity realized. 

However, our economy continues to be aid dependent, import driven and highly 
vulnerable. Economic development and structural change have not translated into 
commensurate increase in secondary and tertiary sector jobs. Agriculture continues 
to employ about 60 percent of the population mostly in subsistence farming with 
significantly lower returns. The economy lacks diversification and is predominantly 
driven by the hydropower sector which has limited potential for the creation of 
productive jobs to absorb a growing and an increasingly educated labour force. 

Our vision of “high-technology” enterprises engaged in high value low volume 
products and building internationally recognized “centres of excellence” in health 
and education services remain a vision. In the absence of alternate growth centres, 
Thimphu and Phuentsholing continue to attract large number of rural-urban 
migrants. Establishment of dry ports in Phuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar and 
Gelephu to facilitate trade, supposed to have been completed by 2002 and 2007 
respectively, remain unaccomplished. Most significantly, the macro-economic 
imbalances leading to the recent and lingering Rupee shortage is an indication 
of deficiencies in our macro-economic analytical, management and coordination 
capacity which need to be strengthened. 

Our Environment - Our environment remains pristine with 70.46 percent of land 
under forest coverage; 19,751 square kilometers under protected areas and 
biological corridors; and air and water quality within acceptable national standards. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Our efforts towards environment conservation are further reinforced by our 
Constitutional mandate of maintaining a minimum of 60 percent forest coverage 
at all times and our commitment to the global community9 to maintain our status 
as a net sink for green house gasses by ensuring that such emission levels do not 
exceed the sequestration capacity of our forest. 

Our strong environment policies have helped maintain our natural environment, 
much of it pristine. However, population growth, urbanization, industrialization 
and infrastructure expansion are putting strong pressure on the environment 
- particularly in terms of the quality of air, water and solid waste management 
in urban areas and human-wildlife conflict in rural areas. Bhutan is also highly 
vulnerable to climate change related disasters such as Glacial Lake Outburst 
Floods (GLOF), floods, landslides and drought. Furthermore, while Bhutan has 
abundant water resources many of our urban centres and town continue to face 
acute shortages of clean and reliable drinking water facilities, while climate change 
and lack of water management resources result in shortages in rural farms. These 
challenges call for more innovative approaches to balancing our environmental 
aspirations and pressing developmental needs. 

Our Institutions – Constitutional offices such as the Anti-Corruption Commission, 
Election Commission, Royal Audit Authority, Royal Civil Service Commission and 
the Supreme Court have been established. The formation of the Dzongkhag Yargay 
Tshogdu (DYT- Dzongkhag Development Committee) and Gewog Yargay Tshogde 
(GYT – Block Development Committee) in 1981 and 1991, respectively; introduction 
of Gewog based planning framework in the Ninth Plan (2002-2008); and the 
allocation of rationalized formula based grants to local governments in the Tenth 
Plan (2008-2013); have all strengthened the decentralization and democratization 
process. 

However, many of these institutions being relatively new, their effective functioning 
are constrained by lack of proper infrastructure facilities, human resource 
constraints and efficient systems. Strengthening Constitutional bodies and 
empowering local governments are a priority. In particular, to further strengthen 
and deepen decentralization, more needs to be done to enhance their ability to 
raise and retain revenues so that local governments have greater incentives to 
promote commercial activities.

1.4.2 Economic Development Policy 2010 (EDP 2010)


The Economic Development Policy was launched in 2010 to enhance the productive 
capacity of the economy and to provide a strategic direction for economic 
development up to 2020. With a vision to promote a green and self reliant economy 
sustained by an IT enabled knowledge society, the EDP’s stated objectives are to 
achieve economic self-reliance and full employment (97.5 percent) by 2020. The 
strategies set out to achieve the objectives include diversification of the economic 
base with minimal ecological footprint, harnessing and value addition to natural 
resources in a sustainable manner, increasing and diversification of exports, 
promoting Bhutan as an organic brand, promoting industries that build “Brand 
Bhutan”10 and reducing dependency on fossil fuel especially for transportation. The 
first three years since the launch of EDP 2010 were devoted to creating an enabling 
environment, preparatory works for infrastructure expansion such as acquisition of 
land and promotion of Bhutan as a potential destination for investments through 
road-shows in the region. 

A credible and predictable policy environment that minimizes the cost of doing 
business, expedites business start ups, and facilitates Foreign Direct Investment is 
vital to achieve the goal and objective envisaged in the EDP. To create an enabling 
environment for the implementation of EDP 2010, new laws and policies were 
formulated in the last three years. Most significantly, the Foreign Direct Investment 
(FDI) Policy 2002 was revised. Since the adoption of a new FDI Policy in 2010, which 
follows a negative list approach and a priority list for investors, a total of 18 projects 
have been approved compared to 19 projects approved in a span of nine years under 
the previous FDI Policy 2002. The FDIs are mainly in hotel, mineral and metal based 
industries, agro and dairy products and ICT. Many of these new industries, which 
are energy intensive, will be operational once the new hydropower projects are 
commissioned by end 2017-18. The Bhutan Education City Act 2012 was enacted 
to establish Bhutan as an education hub with the entry of high quality educational 
institutions from around the world. Among the policies approved were the Cottage, 
Small and Medium Industry Policy (CSMI) 2012 and Alternative Renewable Energy 
Policy 2013. The Mineral Development Policy, Bhutan Telecommunications and 
Broadband Policy, Public Private Partnership Policy and Business Licensing Policy 
have been drafted and will be approved for implementation in the Eleventh Plan. 

10Brand Bhutan – Natural and pristine environment; vibrant and living culture; nation of GNH; peace 
and security; reliable and competitively priced energy; will form some of the country’s Unique Selling 
Proposition (USP) based on which Brand Bhutan will be developed.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Besides, other new laws and policies proposed in EDP 2010 such as Consumer 
Protection Act, Competition Policy, Trade Development Act, Investment Law, 
and Amendment of Companies Act 2000 will be drafted and implemented in the 
Eleventh Plan. 

Additionally, Fiscal Incentives 2010 was implemented to stimulate private sector 
growth and employment generation. The incentives are categorized as General 
Incentives (applicable to all sectors), Specific Incentives (cross-sector incentives 
such as Cottage & Small Industries) and Sector-specific Incentives (such as ICT, 
Tourism, Film and Media). However, the experience of using fiscal incentives to 
promote private sector development in Bhutan has been wrought with challenges, 
falling short of expectations as well as creating rent seeking behavior. It is widely 
felt that fiscal incentives during the Ninth Plan period largely resulted in industries 
that exploited tax differentials without any significant contribution to long term 
industrial development, employment and growth. In view of the above, regular 
assessment of the impact of fiscal incentives on private sector development and 
employment generation and concrete recommendations on how they could be 
better aligned to achieving the objectives of EDP 2010 is necessary. 

While an enabling environment and fiscal incentives are important, they cannot 
compensate for structural bottlenecks, especially the lack of infrastructure, skilled 
manpower and access to finance. Therefore, much remains to be done in terms 
of the physical progress of activities to facilitate private sector development and 
economic growth. The establishment of industrial parks, dry ports, and completion 
of alternate southern east-west highway, will therefore be expedited on a priority 
basis during the current Plan. 

Ultimately, the successful implementation of EDP 2010 will depend on ensuring 
that its objectives are supported by clear-cut strategies, policies, and support 
systems that harness our competitive advantages and address our constraints. An 
analysis of the EDP 2010 reveals that this vital linkage is weak at best and in some 
cases an obvious gap exists. For example, four of the constraints point to a lack 
of trained human resources but human resource development is conspicuously 
absent as a strategy. Similarly the strategies do not address macro-economic 
issues related to balance of payments, fiscal deficit and foreign exchange which are 
highlighted as vital challenges. Of the 8 competitive advantages listed, the most 
strategic is Bhutan’s geographical proximity and open access to the large Indian 
market. The EDP is however silent on how Bhutan can leverage its location to its 

01

BACKGROUND



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

advantage. In this regard, it would be vital to firstly identify the medium and long 
term growth sectors in India and the region subsequently determine those that are 
most feasible for Bhutan.

• Promote industries that

image, 
• Reduce dependency on 
fossil fuel especially in 
respect to transportation.






Financing of the EDP is another vital constraint that needs to be addressed. There 
are two aspects to this. Firstly, given limited domestic resources, the success of 
the EDP for the formal sector and large business projects is hinged on mobilizing 
external resources through FDI and alternative financing options. Secondly, access 
to financing for SMEs and rural enterprises needs to be enhanced. SMEs play an 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

important role in employment creation, rural income generation and poverty 
alleviation. According to the National Statistics Bureau, 98 percent of the 17,642 
industries registered as of 2008 fall into the cottage and small category, which 
underscores the importance of this segment in self-employment and income 
generation. The EDP provides some fiscal incentives to promote these industries 
though tax holidays. However, small enterprises require more than just tax 
incentives for startup and moving up the value chain. An actionable strategy to 
incubate a wide range of potential enterprises, address capacity constraints and 
provide access to finance and loans for SMEs is vital. Strengthening this aspect of 
the EDP would go a long way in its successful implementation, especially for creation 
of gainful employment opportunities and development of “niche industries” that 
is the cornerstone of EDP 2010. 

All the above require a short, medium and long term strategy given structural, 
institutional and human resource capacity constraints and the time lag in 
addressing them. In this regard, the effective engagement of the private sector as 
a collaborative partner in the design of a clear roadmap for the implementation of 
the EDP 2010 during the Eleventh Plan period is imperative and will be accorded 
a high priority. 

1.4.3 Least Developed Country (LDCs) Status


The achievement of Vision 2020 and EDP 2010 objectives are critical for Bhutan’s 
graduation from the category of LDCs by 2020. For a country to graduate from 
LDC, three criteria need to be fulfilled as follows:

• Income criterion, is assessed on a three-year average estimate of GNI per 
capita, based on the World Bank Atlas method. The graduation threshold 
for 2012 triennial review was USD 1,190. 
• Human Assets Index (HAI) based on indicators of: (a) nutrition: percentage 
of population undernourished; (b) health: mortality rate for children aged 
five years or under; (c) education: the gross secondary school enrolment 
ratio; and (d) adult literacy rate. HAI threshold is 66 or more and Bhutan 
scored 59 in 2012.
• Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) based on indicators of: (a) population 
size; (b) remoteness; (c) merchandise export concentration; (d) share of 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries in gross domestic product; (e) share of 


01

BACKGROUND



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

population living in low elevated coastal zones; (f) instability of exports 
of goods and services; (g) victims of natural disasters; and (h) instability 
of agricultural production. EVI threshold for graduation is 32 or less and 
Bhutan scored 44.2 in 2012. 


As per the United Nations 2012 country data review11, Bhutan fulfills the income 
criteria but remains below the graduation threshold on HAI and EVI. 

The challenges confronting HAI include (a) malnutrition among children - almost 
one in eight children under five in Bhutan are moderately underweight (12.7 
percent) and 3.2 percent were classified as severely underweight. More than one 
third of children (33.5 percent) are moderately stunted or too short for their age, 
out of which 13.3 percent were severely stunted. Wasting is a reflection of acute 
malnutrition and moderate wasting is estimated at 5.9 percent and severe wasting 
at 2 percent (BMIS 2010). (b) under five years mortality rate per 1,000 live births 
remain high at 69 (AHB 2012); (c) adult literacy remains low at 55.3 percent (BLSS 
2012). 

In terms of EVI, the challenges include (a) population size – Small countries have 
fewer possibilities for economic diversification and when exposed to natural 
shocks often the whole country is affected. Bhutan with a population of less than 
700,000 is vulnerable to such shocks. (b) remoteness – Bhutan being a landlocked 
and mountainous country is handicapped by high transportation costs and 
other constraints of landlocked LDCs that reduce our ability to respond to trade 
shocks. (c) instability of exports of goods and services - Bhutan’s largest export 
is hydropower to India followed by exports of mineral and metal based products 
(where low electricity cost is its comparative advantage). Therefore, our exports 
are highly vulnerable to hydrological risks and effective functioning of hydropower 
plants. Agriculture products comes a distant third with about 5 percent of total 
exports. (d) victims of natural disasters – threats of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood 
(GLOF), landslides, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires and windstorms are real. 
In the last few years, Bhutan has faced a number of such natural disasters where 
lives and properties have been lost. (e) Instability of agricultural production – 
besides natural disasters, agriculture production is affected by growing problems 
of human-wildlife conflict, competition from agricultural imports from the region, 
pestilence like the recent attack of army worms which affected most of the country 
in 2013.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

With a strong emphasis on improving the health and education outcomes, 
achieving progress in the HAI may not be a major constraint other than improving 
the adult literacy rate which may pose a challenge. However, improving the EVI will 
require special efforts particularly in addressing economic imbalances, productive 
capacities and diversification challenges. This will not be easy. Hence, the goodwill, 
support and cooperation of our development partner in the coming years will 
be critical for Bhutan. Furthermore, even beyond 2020, Bhutan may require 
continued cooperation and support from its development partners to ensure that 
the transition will help establish a solid economic foundation that is dynamic and 
resilient.

2.1 Population

Population is a vital component of sustainable and equitable people-centered 
development. The interplay of fertility, mortality and migration affect not only 
demographic, economic and social development but also socio-cultural cohesion. 
Understanding the present and future composition of the population and its spatial 
distribution is necessary for the formulation of people centered Five Year socio-
economic development plans. According to the first decennial Population and 
Housing Census of Bhutan (PHCB 2005) carried out in 2005, the total population of 
Bhutan was 672,425. 

With a floating population of 37,443,the actual resident population of Bhutan 
was 634,982 persons, of which 52.5 percent were males and 47.5 percent were 
females, while the rural and urban composition was 69.1 percent and 30.9 percent 
respectively. Statistical Year Book 2012 (NSB) has estimated a population of 
720,679 in 2012 with an average household size of 4.6 and a population growth 
rate of 1.3 percent.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

With a total surface area of 38,816 square kilometers and a total population of 
634,982, the population density was 16 persons per square kilometer as per PHCB 
2005. Thimphu was the most densely populated Dzongkhag with a population of 
98,676 and a density of 54 persons per square kilometers while Gasa was the least 
with a population density of 1 person per square kilometer.

2.1.2 Growth Rate

The population growth rate13 has 
been on the decline from 3.1 per 
cent in 1994 to 1.3 percent in 2012 
(Statistical Yearbook 2012 NSB). If 
the present trends continues, growth 
rates are projected to decline to 1.1 
percent in 2020, 0.9 percent in 2030 
and 0.4 percent in 2050 (Population 
Projections (2005-2050), Working 
Committee for draft NPP 2012). 

The mortality rate, specifically the crude death rate (CDR) has declined from 13 per 
1000 persons in 1984 to 8.5 per 1000 persons in 201214. Similarly, with the decline 
in mortality, total fertility rate (TFR) has also constantly declined over the period, 
from around 6 children per woman during the 1980s to 2.6 children in 2010. 

Despite the decline in both mortality and fertility rates, an incremental growth will 
be experienced due to the population momentum effect which occurs when a large 
proportion of the population are of child-bearing age. However, if the TFR drops 
to below replacement level (average of 2.1 surviving children per woman) Bhutan 
will experience a much slower population growth. Currently, in the absence of a 
comprehensive National Population Policy efforts have been towards controlling 
population growth. However, for a country with a small population this could 
have an adverse impact in terms of security, demographic and socio-economic 
development. The draft National Population Policy has been drafted and will be 
presented for approval by the Cabinet in the Eleventh Plan. The National Population 
Policy will be the basis for planning a stable and sustainable population growth.

2.1.3 Age Structure and Sex Composition

The age structure and sex composition of a 
population is represented by a population 
pyramid. PHCB 2005 estimates that a large 
proportion of the population is below the 
age of 24 years, comprising 56 percent of 
the total population. The narrowing of the 
base may be indicative of declining births 
in recent years.

BLSS 2012 estimates nearly half the 
population is below 25 years of age. 
Children (below 15 years of age) 
accounted for 30 percent of the 
population, and the elderly (aged 60 and 
above), about 10 percent. The overall gender ratio was 97 males per 100 females.

Bhutan’s youthful population provides opportunities of demographic bonus15. 
However, this window of opportunity will remain only if we are able to gainfully 
utilize the youth population to contribute towards productive economic 
development. 

2.1.4 Differently-abled Persons

The PHCB 2005 revealed that 21,894 persons or 3.4 percent of the total population 
were differently-abled, of which 45.7 percent were females and 54.3 percent were 
males. Among the Dzongkhags, Lhuentse and Trongsa had the highest proportion 
of the differently-abled persons with 6.4 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.

The most common forms of disability acquired since birth were speech and hearing. 
On the other hand, the most common forms of disability acquired after birth are 
visual and hearing followed by mobility. Visual and hearing were more severe 
among the elderly population (50 years and above) while moving and speech were 
among the younger population (0-4 years). Mental health problems were high in 
the age group 15-39 years and gradually declined thereafter.

15Demographic Bonus is a prominent presence of people in the productive age group (15-64 years), 
which can contribute to high economic growth due to the favourable Dependability Ratio.

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Various other reports also suggest prevalence of disability, particularly among 
children aged 2-9 years, in Bhutan. Bhutan’s Two-Stage Child Disability Study 
2010-11 reports prevalence of children with a single disability at 13.8 per cent, 
compared to 7.6 per cent prevalence of children living with multiple disabilities. 
While Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010 reports 30.4 percent of children to 
have at least one disability, with the highest proportion (31.5 percent) living in the 
eastern region. The disability prevalence was higher among children of illiterate 
mothers, poor and those living in remote areas.

2.1.5 Migration 

As per PHCB 2005, rural to urban migration (111,770) accounted for the highest 
population move followed by rural to rural migration (111,548) within the country. 
There were about 19,992 people who moved from urban to rural areas while 23,874 
people moved from urban to urban centres. The highest proportion of migrants 
(31.5 percent) migrated for family reasons. This was followed by 17 percent for 
employment, 15 percent for education and training, 11 percent due to marriage, 
10 percent for work transfer, 3.4 percent for resettlement, 7 percent living with 
relatives, and the remaining 7 percent for other unspecified reasons. 

In terms of Dzongkhag-wise net migration, Thimphu received the highest with 
39,770 persons and Trashigang had the highest outflow of 16,697 persons. 

2.1.6 Population Projections – 2020, 2030 and 2050

The projections are based on medium variant projection. The medium variant 
projection assumes that the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 births per woman will 
be attained by 2020, given that 2010 TFR is 2.6. The purpose of presenting this 
projection is to present the likely scenario in the coming decades. 

Despite the gradual decrease in population growth rate, the population is expected 
to reach 818,791 persons by 2020, and will further increase to 1,038,445 persons 
by 2050. The average annual growth rates implied in the projection is going to 
decrease during the projection period from a high of 2.1 percent in 2006 to a low 
of 0.4 percent by 2050, if the fertility is brought to the replacement level of 2.1 
(two surviving children per woman) during the period 2005-2020 and remains 
unchanged thereafter. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The population density is projected to increase from 16 persons per sq km in 
2005 to 27 persons per sq km by 2050. During the period 2005-2050, the working 
age population is estimated to grow by around 73.6 per cent. This window of 
opportunity can result in demographic dividends16 if accompanied by adequate 
savings, investments, sound public policies and the full participation of youth and 
women. The youth population (15-24 years) is expected to increase from 129,403 
in 2020 to 171,563 by 2030.

16The rise in the rate of economic growth due to increase in the number and proportion of 
population in the working age or productive ages (15-64 years). 

17The average number of children that would be born alive to a woman (or a group of women) 
during her lifetime if she were to pass through her child bearing years conforming to the age-
specific fertility rates of a given year. This indicator shows the potential for population growth in 
the country.

18Dependency ratio is the ratio of children (< 15 years of age) and elderly population (65+ years) to 
the size of the working population (15-64 years).



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The young population indicated by the median age19 of 22 years implies that the 
population will continue to increase in the near future due to the population 
momentum20 effect. Moreover, the ageing population (65 years and above) is 
projected to increase from 7 percent in 2005 to 11.7 percent by 2050 and will 
further grow with the improvements in health and life expectancy rates. Overall 
life expectancy at birth increased from 47.5 years in 1984 to 66.3 years in 2005 and 
is projected to reach 75 years for male and 78.3 years for females by 2050. The 
dependency ratio is expected to decline from 60 percent in 2005 to 56.6 percent 
and 44 percent by 2020 and 2030 respectively. Subsequently it is expected to rise 
as the working age population moves into the older age group leading to high old 
age dependency ratio.

On the basis of the above projections, major demographic considerations for the 
Eleventh Plan include:

• Adoption of a National Population Policy to provide clear direction for 
future demographic planning in terms of the desired level of population 
growth rates.
• Exploiting the opportunities provided by “demographic bonus” to create a 
vibrant and sustainable economy. 
• Implementation of special programmes to address the challenges of 
the growing number of older population, differently-abled persons and 
migratory trends.


19Median Age: The age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups; that is, half the 
people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age 
distribution of a population. 

20Population momentum refers to population growth at the national level which would occur even 
if levels of childbearing immediately declined to replacement level.

2.2.1 Poverty 

A poverty analysis based on the Bhutan Living Standard Survey has been carried 
out once every five years since 2003. According to the most recent “Poverty 
Analysis Report 2012”poverty incidence has declined from 31.7 percent in 2003 
to 12 percent in 2012, exceeding the Tenth Plan target of reducing poverty to 15 
percent.

As reflected above, rural poverty was reduced from 38.3 percent to 16.7 percent 
while urban poverty was reduced from 4.2 percent to 1.8 percent over the same 
period. Similarly, inequalities in income, measured in terms of Gini-coefficient, 
have been reduced from 0.416 in 2003 to 0.36 in 2012. 

The reduction in poverty is attributed to provision of infrastructure facilities such 
as roads, electricity, telecommunication, water and sanitation and the success of 
targeted poverty reduction programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement 
Programme (REAP) and the National Rehabilitation Programme.

Characteristics of the poor and non-poor 

A review of the characteristic of the poor and non-poor on the basis of Poverty 
Analysis Report of 2003, 2007 and 2012 reveal poverty is a rural phenomenon. Those 
employed in agriculture were poorer while poverty was less acute in households 
with educated heads. Poor families also tended to have a bigger family size.

In the Eleventh Plan, the target will be to reduce overall income poverty rate 
from 12 percent in 2012 to less than 5 percent by 2018 with particular focus on 
Dzongkhags with poverty levels above the national average. 

2.2.2 Multi-dimensional Poverty

On a multi-dimensional measure21, poverty in Bhutan is deemed to be 25.8 percent 
in 2010. The thirteen indicators that comprise Bhutan’s initial Multi-dimensional 
Poverty Index (MPI) measured in terms of health, education and living standards 
are i) primary schooling and ii) children out of school (education); iii) child mortality, 
iv) nutrition and v) food insecurity (health); and vi) electricity, vii) housing, viii) 
cooking fuel, ix) drinking water less than 30 minutes away, x) improved sanitation 
and xi) asset ownership of livestock, xii) land and xiii) appliances (living standards). 
The highest levels of deprivation pertain to access to improved sanitation (pit 
latrines with slab), cooking fuel (if wood, dung or charcoal used), schooling (five 
years of school education) and electricity. From the three core domains, education 
(41 percent) contributes the highest to multidimensional poverty followed by 
living standards (37 percent) and health (23 percent).

The target for the Eleventh Plan is to reduce multi-dimensional poverty from 25.8 
percent in 2010 to less than 10 percent by 2018.

2.2.3 Income Poverty, Multi-dimensional Poverty and GNH Index

A comparison of twenty Dzongkhags in terms of income poverty, multidimensional 
poverty and GNH 2010 Index, reveal Paro Dzongkhag as the happiest Dzongkhag 
with low incidence of both multidimensional and income poverty and Samdrup 
Jongkhar Dzongkhag as the least happy with both income and multidimensional 
poverty higher than the national average. Gasa Dzongkhag has the second lowest 
incidence of income poverty but is also second poorest in terms of multidimensional 
measure. Gasa has high levels of income from cordyceps but due to difficult terrain 
and remoteness it also suffers from lack of access to health and education facilities.

 

2.2.4 Millennium Development Goals

While the last review of Bhutan’s progress towards MDGs was carried out in 
November 200821, recent statistics indicate that Bhutan has made good progress. 
We have already achieved many of the targets and are on track to achieve most by 
2015 or earlier. Some of the MDGs falling behind are chronic malnutrition among 
children below the age of 5, ratio of female to male in tertiary institutions, maternal

mortality rate, under five mortality rate, infant mortality rate, number of HIV cases 
detected and the growing youth unemployment. Accordingly, in the Eleventh Plan, 
the objective is to strive for MDG Plus targets, targets equivalent or near to that of 
the developed countries, for those goals already achieved and likely to be achieved 
and to accelerate progress towards those falling behind. 

In this respect, the support and cooperation of our development partners will be 
critical to overcome some of the challenges confronted by Bhutan as follows: 

• The status of MDGs presented below represents national level aggregates and 
often national level aggregates mask disparities at local levels. For instance, 
income poverty at national level in 2012 was 12 percent. At disaggregated 
level, it ranges from a low on 0.5 percent (Thimphu, Paro and Gasa) to a high of 
31.5 percent in Lhuentse. Similarly disparities are seen in health and education 
outcomes when disaggregated at local levels - among Dzongkhags/Gewogs, 
between rural urban and on the basis of gender. Therefore, addressing these 
disparities and the last mile challenges requires special efforts and substantial 
resources.
• The other challenge is sustaining the MDG achievements. While the initial 
investments on many of the MDGs were supported by our development 
partners, sustaining the achievements will largely have to be through domestic 
resources. Therefore, mobilization, prioritization and allocation of domestic 
resources to sustain the MDGs will be vital. 
• The improved national level indicators have resulted in some of our 
development partners indicating their desire to phase out development 
assistance from Bhutan. However, addressing MDGs at disaggregated levels, 
sustainability, accelerating progress towards those goals falling behind and 
striving for higher MDG Plus goals requires substantial resources and efforts. 
Also, cost of reaching the unreached are significantly higher. Hence, till Bhutan 
is able to finance and sustain the MDGs, the support and cooperation of the 
development partners will be crucial. 


The status of MDGs is shown in Table 2.5. The targets in green indicate achieved or

2.3 Preservation and Promotion of Culture

Preservation and promotion of our rich cultural heritage is a critical element to 
strengthening national cohesion, identity and unity, which are vital for the peace, 

02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

stability and sovereignty of our nation. Accordingly, culture is accorded high 
priority in our socio-economic development plans. The emphasis is not only 
on preserving and promoting our cultural heritage, but also recognizing it as an 
“evolving dynamic force” and the need “to strengthen and facilitate the continued 
evolution of traditional values and institutions that are sustainable as a progressive 
society” as provided in Article 4 of the Constitution.

2.3.1 Cultural Heritage and Tradition

Recognizing the importance of cultural heritage and tradition in maximizing GNH, 
two out of the nine domains in the GNH Index are devoted to strengthening our 
cultural heritage, namely: i) ‘Cultural Diversity and Resilience’, which emphasizes 
the promotion of our national language, cultural participation, artistic skills and 
Driglam Namzha (etiquette/traditions that define national character) and; ii) 
‘Community Vitality’, which focuses on family, community relationships, voluntary 
contributions and investment in time and money to society, and safety. 

The preservation and promotion of cultural heritage includes both tangible and 
intangible heritage. Tangible heritage include Dzongs, monasteries, temples, 
religious objects and relics in the form of manuscripts and statues. Intangible 
heritage include Driglam Namzha, national dress, language, arts and crafts, food, 
and traditional games and festivals.

Notable achievements, besides renovation and conservation of many Dzongs and 
monasteries, include:

• Implementation of guidelines for conservation of heritage sites by all 
conservation projects. 
• Establishment of an archaeology unit under the Ministry of Home & Cultural 
Affairs. 
• Archiving and microfilming facilities of important historical documents and 
records in the National Library of Bhutan. Bill on Archives of Bhutan is being 
formulated to strengthen and protect the system. 
• To promote the national language, digital Dzongkha dictionary, Dzongkha 
keyboard layout in phones with Android software and Dzongkha language 
support in phones with Maemo software (such as the Nokia 900 series) have 
been developed. 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

• The Royal Textile Academy in Thimphu, which will serve as a textile school, 
museum and conservation centre, was inaugurated in June 2013. 


While many initiatives have been taken, further efforts to promote our national 
language and cultural heritage/traditions will be pursued. 

2.3.2 Culture and Livelihood

The preservation and promotion of culture is also an important source of livelihood, 
particularly for our rural communities, through the development of cultural 
industries. Some of the notable initiatives and achievements to promote cultural 
industries include:

• Craft Bazaar, with 80 stalls, was established in Thimphu in 2011 to showcase 
a wide range of authentic Bhutanese arts and crafts. It has facilitated the 
creation of a viable venue for rural artisans to market their products.
• The certification system, ‘Made in Bhutan Seal’, was launched in May 2012 
to authenticate wholly produced and/or substantially transformed products 
with required minimum value addition within Bhutan. 
• Interventions to set-up craft clusters based on regional comparative advantages, 
raw-material banks, design banks, product development and marketing are being 
undertaken by the newly established Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts.
• The Bhutanese film and music industry is gaining increasing popularity and 
have completely edged out foreign films from local cinema halls. Since the 
first film Gasa Lamai Singye in 1988, the industry has now produced a total 
of about 300 films, with an average annual production of 30 films. Similarly, 
about 400 music albums have been marketed. The industry is also making 
significant contribution towards promotion of national language, culture and 
traditions and in conveying social messages on HIV, drugs and youth related 
issues. A draft Film Policy has been developed in order to promote, diversify 
and professionalize a sustainable film industry in the country. 
• Cultural tourism has been growing with the introduction of new tourism 
products such as rural home-stays/farm houses and community lodges 
besides promotion of festivals, Dzongs and monasteries. From the total of 
about 100,833 visitors during 2012 about 77 percent of tourists visited Bhutan 
on cultural tourism. 


02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

In the Eleventh Plan, cultural industries will be given high priority in view of the 
multiple benefits it offers in terms of promotion of culture, poverty reduction, 
enhancing rural income and employment generation. 

2.4 Conservation and Sustainable Utilization and Management 
of Environment 

Bhutan has always accorded high priority to environmental conservation. With 
strong environmental legislation, policies and programmes, we have been able to 
maintain forest coverage of 70.5 percent, exceeding the Constitutional mandate 
of maintaining 60 percent forest coverage at all times. With 51.32 percent of the 
country under a protected area network, which include ten protected areas and 
biological corridors, Bhutan is host to one of the highest percentage of protected 
areas in the world. 

Bhutan has successfully fulfilled its international obligations under the Montreal 
Protocol to phase out 100 percent of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other Ozone 
Depleting Substances (ODS) by 2010. We have pledged to perpetually remain a net 
carbon sink and carbon neutral country during 
the COP 15 conference held in Copenhagen in 
2009. In keeping with this pledge, Bhutan has 
prepared a National Strategy and Action Plan 
for Low Carbon Development which will be 
operationalized in the Eleventh Plan. 

Further, in our efforts to capture benefits that 
people derive from the natural environment, 
work on establishing GNH Accounts23, covering 
ecological capital, cultural capital, human 
capital, social capital and economic capital 
has started. The preliminary estimates show 
that Bhutan’s natural wealth provides Nu.760 
billion (USD $ 15 billion) a year in ecosystem 
services, of which forests alone provide 93.8 
percent, with the remainder attributable to

23Efforts initiated with support of Dr Ida Kubiszewski and Professor Robert Costanza. However, it 
will take some time for Bhutan to come up with a full and detailed GNH Accounts as there are many 
challenges of methodology, valuation, capacity constraints etc.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

services provided by rivers, lakes, cropland, and wetlands. Of the total value, 53 
percent of the benefits go to people outside Bhutan in services like forest carbon 
sequestration and watershed protection, and 47 percent to our own people in 
clean air, water, healthy soils, recreation, and other values. 

Other initiatives towards conservation of natural environment include: adoption of 
policy to promote organic agriculture production; strong focus on and expansion of 
community forestry programmes; establishment of a core group for Mainstreaming 
Gender, Environment, Climate, Disaster Risk Reduction and Poverty (GECDP) to assist 
sectors in mainstreaming these elements in their policies, plans, and programmes; 
enactment of new laws such as the Waste Prevention and Management Act 2009 
and the Water Act in 2011; and the introduction of a progressive green tax that 
charges 20 percent for vehicles above 1800 cc and 5 percent for smaller or public 
transport, freight and utility vehicles that benefit the rural population.

In spite of these efforts towards environmental conservation, Bhutan has been a 
victim of natural disasters some of which are attributed to climate change. In the 
last five years, earthquake, cyclone, windstorm, floods, landslides and fires have 
been a frequent occurrence as follows:

• May 2009: Cyclone Aila - ,which claimed 13 lives and caused extensive damage 
to public and private properties with losses of Nu.719 million (US$17 million).
• September 2009: Earthquake - 6.2 on the Richter Scale hit eastern parts of 
the country. It claimed 12 lives and damaged 4,950 rural homes, temples, 
and monasteries, 117 schools, 45 BHUs, 29 RNR Centres, and 26 Gup 
offices, with losses estimated at Nu.2.5 billion (US$52 million).
• September 2011, Earthquake with its epicenter in Sikkim and measuring 
6.8 on the Richter scale, this time striking the western part of the country. 
It claimed one life, injured 14 people, and damaged 6,977 rural homes 
and temples, 36 schools, 22 BHUs, 27 RNR Centres, and 30 other public 
buildings, with losses estimated at Nu.1.2 billion (US$24.46 million).
• Series of fires in 2010 and 2011 razed homes and shops in the town of 
Chamkhar, the satellite town of Wamrong, and three homes in Haa.
• 24 June 2012 - A most grievous loss, which left the country stunned, was the 
devastating fire that consumed the precious 374 years old Wangduephodrang 
Dzong.


02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

To better prepare to deal with such natural disasters, a new Department of Disaster 
Management was created in 2008, a Disaster Management Bill 2011 was passed 
by the Parliament in 2013, extensive public education and awareness on hazards, 
risks and vulnerabilities of disaster were conducted, early warning systems in major 
river basins were established and various disaster management response teams 
including the voluntary Disaster Relief organization De-suung have been created. 

Conservation of the natural environment to maintain a sustainable balance 
between economic development and environment conservation and improving 
disaster resilience and management will be given utmost importance in the 
Eleventh Plan. Capacity building through training of engineers and technicians, 
green engineering, and review and revision of Bhutan Building Rules to incorporate 
disaster resilient constructions will be carried out. 

2.5 Promotion of Good Governance 

Good Governance an important pillar for a vibrant democracy and sustainable and 
equitable socio-economic development, and therefore, continued efforts have 
been made to strengthen good governance. 

2.5.1 Democracy and Governance

The second Parliamentary elections were successfully held in 2013. The election 
to the National Council was held on 23 April 2013. The voter turnout was 45.16 
percent with 171,544 voters voting, out of the total registered voters of 379,819. 
67 candidates stood for elections to 20 seats. No women were elected though six 
had registered. Of the five eminent members nominated by His Majesty the King, 
two were women. 

For the National Assembly seats, the primary round was held on 31 May 2013. 
From the four24 registered political parties, Druk Phuensum Tshogpa (DPT) and 
People’s Democratic Party (PDP) went through to the general round having 
secured the highest and second highest votes, respectively. The voter turnout was 
55.27 percent with 211,018 casting their votes from the total registered voters of 
381,790.

The general round for the National Assembly elections was held on 13 July 2013.
The People’s Democratic Party having secured 32 National Assembly Seats was 

24The other two political parties were Druk Nyamrup Tshogpa and Druk Chirwang Tshogpa



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

elected to form the new government and Druk Phuensum Tshogpa with 15 Seats 
the opposition party. The overall voter turnout was 66.1 percent with 252,485 
voters casting their votes out of a total of 381,790 registered voters.

The local government elections were held in 2011. From the total of 2,185 
candidates 1,104 representatives were elected at various levels. Of the 165 female 
candidates 76 were elected to office. The voter turnout was 56 percent.

Further, constitutional bodies such as the Election Commission, Royal Audit 
Authority and Anti Corruption Commission had been established prior to the 
transition to democracy while the Supreme Court and the Royal Civil Service 
Commission (RCSC) reconstituted, as per the Constitution following the inception 
of democracy. Laws and regulations have been put in place to assist them in 
fulfilling their constitutional mandates and to ensure independence in discharging 
of their functions. 

2.5.2 Public Service Management

Civil Service - To create a dynamic and professional civil service, a number of 
civil service reforms have been implemented over the years. For instance, the 
Position Classification System was introduced in 2006 to promote meritocracy and 
enhance efficiency, transparency, professionalism and accountability in the civil 
service. An organizational development exercise was conducted in 2007 to define 
the optimal size, structures and capacity building of the civil service. Additionally, 
to help regulate and further improve the civil service, the Civil Service Act 2010 
and revised Civil Service Rules and Regulations 2012 were introduced following the 
reconstitution of RCSC in 2009. 

Currently, there are 24,275 civil servants, of which 67 percent are male and 
33 percent female. About 57 percent of the civil servants are in Dzongkhag 
Administration and Thromdes and the rest with the central agencies. Two percent 
of the civil servants (559) were expatriates. On an average, civil service has been 
growing at the rate of 4 percent per annum over the last five years and pay and 
allowance to civil servants constitute about 45 percent of the total recurrent 
expenditure. 

In the Eleventh Plan, the government will commission a comprehensive review of 
the civil service to identify shortcomings and challenges and to further improve 
efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service.

02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Public Service Delivery - One of the most important functions of the government is 
to provide efficient and effective public service delivery to its people. Towards this, 
a number of new initiatives were undertaken in the last five years, which include:

Government to Citizen Services (G2C) was initiated in 2010 to increase efficiency 
and transparency in public service delivery through the use of ICT. About 136 most 
commonly availed services ranging from civil registration, timber permits, and 
security clearance were streamlined and automated to reduce the service delivery 
turn-around-time by 70 percent. Online services are made available through 131 
Community Centres (CCs) connected with internet and the remaining 74 CCs will 
provide the service after internet connectivity is established in the Eleventh Plan. 

Agencification Guidelines 2012 – Agencification Guidelines was issued to improve 
performance and public service delivery by an agency/organization by separating 
planning and policy-making, regulatory and implementation functions and by 
facilitating higher flexibility in terms of key organizational processes such as human 
resource management, procurement, budgeting and performance management. 
Since the adoption of Agencification Guidelines, 12 new departments under various 
ministries were created, six government departments were granted autonomous 
status and four agencies were delinked from the civil service. 

Government Performance Management System (GPMS) – was initiated to a) drive 
clarity of objectives for the Ministry/Dzongkhag; b) enhance accountability and 
performance; and c) allow efficient resource allocation/utilisation. It maps out 
tangible targets in terms of outputs, key performance indicators and activities and 
other essential metrics that will facilitate measuring the performance of all central 
and local government agencies. 

The full implementation of GPMS across all government agencies will be completed 
during the Eleventh Plan. The system will be used to measure the Key Performance 
Indicator of “average performance rating of government agency targeted at more 
than 90 percent” under the National Key Result Area of Improved Public Service 
Delivery. Efforts will also be made to cascade this to individual levels so that it 
can be used as the basis for performance evaluation and meritocracy in the civil 
service.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

2.5.3 Transparency, Accountability and Control of Corruption

With the introduction of parliamentary democracy and the establishment of 
various democratic processes, transparency and accountability has been further 
enhanced with increased public participation in policy making. In addition to 
the Legislative Committee established in 2003 and Public Accounts Committee 
established in 2004, 12 new committees were established in 2008 during the First 
session of First National Assembly. The first session of the second Parliament held 
in September 2013 restructured the existing 14 committees to ten committees. 

Financial Accountability: To ensure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in use of 
public resources, annual audit is carried out by the Royal Audit Authority (RAA), a 
supreme audit institution and a constitutional body that functions independently 
and reports directly to the Parliament. 

In 2012, the Royal Audit Authority conducted 600 audits during the year including 
500 normal audits, 98 certification audits, 1 performance based audit and 1 
thematic audit. The irregularities reported decreased to Nu. 391.007 million in 
2012 from Nu. 770.141 million in 2011, decrease of 49 percent. The irregularities 
comprised of 47 percent categorized under Shortfalls, Lapses and Deficiencies, 33 
percent under Fraud, Corruption and Embezzlement, 12 percent under Violation 
of Rules and Regulations and 8 percent under mismanagement. 

Curbing Corruption: To control corruption, the Royal Government has taken 
several proactive measures, starting with the establishment of an Anti Corruption 
Commission (ACC) in 2005, enactment of Anti Corruption Act 2011 (repealing 
ACA 2006), adopting “Zero Tolerance towards Corruption” policy and becoming 
a signatory to the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2005. Other 
rules and regulations put in place to curb corruption include Gift Rules 2009, The 
Debarment (of Corrupt Firms) Rules 2008 and Asset Declaration Rule 2012.

The ACC’s 2012-13 annual report shows corruption is still a major challenge 
although people’s perception of the prevalence of corruption is declining. In 2012-
2013, ACC received 449 complaints compared to 458 cases in the previous year. 
The major areas of complaints were misuse of resources like government property 
and funds followed by personnel, land, construction and procurement of goods 
and services. Among the types of corruption, the misuse of authority continues to 
be a major issue with 564 complaints, followed by embezzlement and nepotism 
with 397 and 351 complaints respectively.

02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The National Integrity Assessment (NIA) Survey 201225 reports a national integrity 
score of 8.37 on a scale of 0-10 (0 means highly corrupt and 10 highly transparent). 
Similarly, Transparency International’s 2012 Corruption Perception Index ranked 
Bhutan 33rd among the 176 nations, an improvement of five positions from 38th in 
2011. 

While corruption perception figures indicate improvements, further efforts will be 
made towards strengthening and supporting institutions combating corruption as 
there can be no room for complacency when it comes to addressing this challenge.

2.5.4 Media

Media in Bhutan is fairly young. Kuensel and Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) 
were established in the mid 1980s as the first Bhutanese newspaper and radio 
station. With the introduction of ICT in the late 1990s, Bhutanese media has grown 
considerably in all its forms – print, broadcast, film, music and internet. Today, 
there are 12 newspapers, six radio stations, two television news channels, and one 
entertainment channel. The growth of a free and responsible media continues to 
receive encouragement and support of the government. 

Further, to promote government transparency and accountability, a fair and 
competitive business environment, personal dignity and to combat corruption, 
the Right to Information Bill was tabled during the first session of the Second 
Parliament in September 2013.

Print Media - With increasing literacy and changing social needs, a number of private 
newspapers and magazines were launched. Bhutan Times and Bhutan Observer 
were licensed in 2006; Bhutan Today in 2008; Business Bhutan and The Journalist 
in 2009; Druk Nyetshul in 2010, Druk Yoedzer and Druk Gyelyong Sharshog in 2011. 
With the increased number of newspapers the market for the print media has 
become competitive. Given the small readership market, advertisement revenues, 
mainly from government agencies, form the major source of revenue for most 
newspapers. Consequently, some of the newspapers have either shut operations 
or suspended print versions due to financial difficulties. 

Radio - Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS) is the national public service broadcaster. 
BBS Radio (then known as Radio NYAB) was started in November 1973 by young 

25Conducted by Anti Corruption Commission of Bhutan and National Statistics Bureau. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

volunteers belonging to the National Youth Association of Bhutan. In 1986, with 
the commissioning of a 10 KW short-wave transmitter and a small broadcast studio, 
Radio NYAB was renamed Bhutan Broadcasting Service. BBS radio broadcasts for 
24 hours in four languages (Dzongkha, Sharchop, Lhotshamkha and English), on 
both shortwave and FM frequency as well as online.

In the last few years, seven private FM Radio Stations , namely Kuzoo FM, Radio 
Valley, Centennial Radio, Radio High, Radio Waves and Sherubtse College were 
established. While the FM services and shortwave services of the BBS reach the 
entire country, Kuzoo FM radio services are available in 18 Dzongkhags, and the 
remaining radio stations services are currently available only in Thimphu. These 
new radio services have created a platform for people to voice their concerns, 
spread awareness and are already addressing a wide range of social issues.

Television - BBS TV is the only television channel that caters to local news and 
programmes within Bhutan and was launched on 2 June 1999. Described as the 
most important event in the history of electronic media in Bhutan, BBS launched its 
satellite television service in February 2006. BBS launched its second TV channel 
‘BBS 2’ in 2012 which broadcasts current programmes and entertainment shows.

Cable television services are now available in 19 of the 20 Dzongkhags and more 
then 40 different channels are provided by the cable TV operators. While the film 
industry is still in its infancy, the number of Bhutanese films has been increasing 
with more people venturing into the industry. A National Film Policy is currently 
being drafted in order to provide further impetus to the industry.

2.5.5 Women’s Empowerment and Gender Equality

The ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination 
Against Women (CEDAW) in 1981 saw the establishment of the National Women’s 
Association of Bhutan (NWAB) with the mandate of addressing the issues related 
to our women and reporting and monitoring on the progress. In order to further 
strengthen the national machinery for women, the National Commission for 
Women and Children (NCWC) was instituted in 2004. Several non-governmental 
organizations working on womens’ issues such as Respect, Educate, Nurture and 
Empower Women (RENEW) and Tarayana Foundation have also been established. 

Women issues in the Tenth Plan were mainly approached in line with the National 

02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Plan of Action for Gender (NPAG), 2008-2013. The seven critical areas identified in 
the NPAG namely: good governance; economic empowerment; violence against 
women; education and training; health; prejudices and stereotypes; and ageing 
mental health and disabilities; provided the platform for addressing gender related 
issues. The NPAG witnessed progress in terms of conducting researches and studies 
identifying challenges and gaps, creating awareness and sensitization on gender 
equality and women’s empowerment and creating an enabling policy environment 
through enactment of issue-specific laws such as the Domestic Violence Prevention 
Act 2013. The Tenth Plan, also witnessed increased data and statistical evidences; 
increased collaboration with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working on the 
issues of women and an increase in the gender discourse movement, evident 
through the media discussions (mainstream and social) and comparatively higher 
levels of incorporation of gender into mainstream sector policies and issues with 
the implementation of the Government’s Policy Protocol. 

Under the area of good governance significant achievements were made in terms 
of conducting surveys and studies to identify factors and challenges influencing the 
participation of our women in governance, creating awareness on their political 
participation, building capacities for women leaders and providing a platform for 
networking amongst the women leaders and aspiring leaders. Provision of support 
services like scholarships for girls from disadvantaged families, establishing girl-
friendly infrastructure in the schools, improving boarder facilities and creating 
an enabling environment were major achievements under the area of education. 
Establishment of Early Childhood, Care and Development Centres (ECCD) and 
extended classrooms helped in increasing girls’ participation in schools. The 
literacy rate of women increased in the plan period due to the expansion of non-
formal education, where over 70 percent of the participants were women, and 
continuing education programmes. 

The critical area of women’s economic empowerment witnessed increased 
participation of women in economic activities through the provision of various 
support like capacity building, entrepreneurial skills development, business 
management programmes and formation of farmers groups, cooperatives and self-
help groups and the provision of micro credit. However, women’s lower participation 
in regular paid employment (6.1 percent as compared to 17.8 percent for men) 
and substantial engagement in agricultural occupations (38.2 percent against 23.7 
percent for men) and the fact that 73 percent26 of our employed women are in the 

26Labour Force Survey, 2012, Ministry of Labour and Human Resources. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

agricultural sector warrants further assessment and special interventions on skills 
development and other economic empowerment measures. Progress has been 
forged in the area of providing social safety for women in the workplace through 
the enactment of the Labour and Employment Act 2007, although enforcement 
may need to be strengthened in the Eleventh Plan. 

Creating awareness among the health personnel and the general public on gender 
related aspects of health, HIV and AIDS, teenage pregnancy, adolescent health 
amongst others have seen good progress over the last five years. Further, significant 
achievements were made to eliminate violence against women (VAW) through 
awareness and sensitization programs, provision of counseling and legal services 
and establishment of shelter services for the victims of VAW. The expansion of 
women and child protection units in 4 police stations, up gradation of complaints 
and response mechanism and establishment of women friendly judicial procedures 
were additional achievements.

The platform for planning and programming in the Eleventh Plan is provided by 
the findings and recommendations of the review of the NPAG and the Gender 
Equality Diagnostic Study of Selected Sectors (GEDSS) namely Education, Urban 
Development, Environment, Energy, Private Sector, Transport, Agriculture and 
Rural Livelihoods, and Work and Unemployment. Other strategies in the Eleventh 
Plan would include: creating a gender responsive legal environment through 
development of a Gender Equality Law including special temporary measures such 
as quotas to enhance women’s participation in governance; implementation of 
the Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting Strategy; strengthening gender 
mainstreaming initiatives/capacity at all levels including the private sector; 
collecting and using sex-disaggregated data; awareness programs at all levels; 
enhancing women’s participation in employment and economic activities; and 
effective monitoring and implementation of current laws, rules and regulations, 
policies, plans and programs.

2.5.6 Promotion and Protection of Child Rights

Firm commitment has been given towards protecting our children and implementing 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) by aligning national legislations to 
related articles in the Convention. Article 9.18 of the Constitution of the Kingdom 
of Bhutan 2008 reaffirms the states’ duties by committing “to take appropriate 

02

CURRENT SITUATION



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

measures to ensure that children are protected against all forms of discrimination 
and exploitation including trafficking, prostitution, abuse, violence, degrading 
treatment and economic exploitation”.

The plan period witnessed a landmark achievement in the Child Protection area 
with the conduct of a mapping and assessment of the Child Protection System 
in Bhutan and the development of a National Plan of Action for Child Protection 
in Bhutan. The assessment clearly indicated current child protection issues, 
challenges faced and recommendations. The following six priority areas for focus 
will be addressed in the eleventh plan in order to ensure systematic and effective 
prevention and response to child protection issues:

• Law, policies, standards and regulations
• Service and service delivery mechanisms across a continuum of care
• Capacity and resources (human, financial and infrastructure)
• Coordination, collaboration and accountability
• Communication and advocacy
• Knowledge management


The enactment of major laws namely the Child Care and Protection Act 2011 and 
the Child Adoption Act of Bhutan 2012 was a major achievement. Other legislations 
such as the Labour and Employment Act 2007, Marriage Act 1980, Inheritance Act 
1980, Citizenship Act 1985 and Royal Bhutan Police Act 2009 also address relevant 
child issues. 

The National Youth Policy has actively included children and called for their 
inclusion in all future discourse that concerns them. Young people such as Young 
Volunteers in Action (YVIA), Scouts Association of Bhutan and Druk Adolescent’s 
Initiative on Sexual Awareness Network (DAISAN) have been formed to inform 
policy makers on their concerns and to integrate them into sector policies. New 
partnerships between young people and government agencies such as the 
Police-Youth Partnership have paved the way for more meaningful dialogue and 
engagement. The educational needs of differently-abled children were addressed 
through integrative education initiated in five schools and establishment of new 
NGOs. Besides the regular teaching programme other skills development trainings 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

were also provided for these children. Special educational needs and early 
childhood care and development are vital components under the draft National 
Education Policy for Bhutan.

2.5.7 Civil Society Organizations (CSO)

With the enactment of Civil Society Organizations Act, 2007 and subsequent 
establishment of the Civil Society Organizations Authority in 2009 the number of 
CSOs have grown. CSOs are in key areas of education, health, women, children, 
culture, environmental protection, and private sector development. Presently 
there are 30 registered CSOs27, of which 24 are Public Benefit Organizations and 6 
Mutual Benefit Organizations. CSOs complement the efforts of the government in 
provision of certain services that the government is unable to deliver or services 
that can be delivered more effectively by such organizations.

CSOs like Tarayana Foundation have contributed in addressing the local needs of 
disadvantaged remote communities through livelihood enhancement programmes 
such as skills training in traditional paper making, traditional clay pot making, 
nettle weaving, soap and candle making, refining cane and bamboo crafts, etc, 
housing support to remote communities like Lhops in south western Bhutan, and 
microfinance etc.

Bhutan Youth Development Fund provides financial support for youth development 
activities like leadership skills, drug rehabilitation, special education, basic skills 
and vocational training, advocacy research and education.

RENEW (Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women) is dedicated to 
empowerment of women and girls in Bhutan, especially the victims and survivors 
of domestic violence.

Draktsho aspires to ensure young persons with Disabilities in Bhutan have quality 
opportunities for developing skills for life and vocation, and for becoming self-
reliant, make a living and lead a contended life overcoming barriers created gender 
or other differences

Many other CSOs have contributed towards addressing various issues such as HIV/
AIDS, Environment, Media etc. In the Eleventh Plan, the government will work 
together with the CSOs to realize the plan objectives.

2.5.8 Mainstreaming of Cross-Cutting Issues

The growing environmental, social and economic issues like environmental 
degradation, over utilization of natural resources, climate change, issues of 
poverty, gender, differently-abled, unemployment and income, food and nutrition, 
health and sanitation and changing nature of natural disasters pose serious threats 
to our hard earned developmental and economic gains and momentum and to 
our goal of sustainable development. Recognizing the fact that these issues are 
all cross-cutting and inextricably linked to the overall developmental process, it 
is imperative that all socio-economic and environmental cross-cutting issues/
concerns are addressed systematically through mainstream development by 
integrating them in our decision making processes of policy making, planning and 
budgeting right at the outset rather than after environmental, social and economic 
degradation has already occurred. 

The mainstreaming of cross cutting issues is to enhance environmental, social 
and economic conditions in an integrated manner through smart developmental 
management and interventions for the effective realization of Eleventh Plan 
goals and for GNH-based development focused on real life outcomes. It will 
also support recognizing environment as a finite resource for all development 
but one that presents great opportunity if managed in an integrated manner 
that exploits all synergies to address important issues. Towards this end in the 
Eleventh Plan, the central level Mainstreaming Reference Group will provide 
advisory and other mainstreaming support while sectors and local governments 
whose mainstreaming capacity has been built will be responsible for effective 
mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues in policy making, planning, budgeting and 
implementation. In the Eleventh Plan efforts will be made towards strengthening 
and institutionalizing the mainstreaming process at all levels of decision making, 
planning and implementation. The mainstreaming tool (six steps process) and 
framework which was developed for sectors and local governments will provide 
support and guidance to the central and local level.

3.1 Macro-Economic Situation





The Tenth Plan’s overarching focus on Poverty Reduction was pursued in the 
context of a robust growth environment despite the global economic downturn in 
2009. Although some effects of the global downturn did manifest in the form of 
reduced tourism revenue and industrial exports, the domestic economy remained 
largely unscathed due to its limited integration with the global economy and 
growth remained buoyant mainly due to huge investments in the hydropower 
sector. While in most countries, the global downturn had a pronounced impact 
on marginalized groups through increased unemployment and erosion of savings, 
Bhutan saw a drop in its unemployment rate and the Government’s poverty 
reduction efforts remained largely on track since most of the poverty stricken in 
Bhutan are subsistence farmers isolated from the formal economy. 

Although Bhutan weathered the global economic crisis well, the economy 
experienced an unprecedented macroeconomic policy challenge arising from a 
successive build-up of current account deficits with India and consequently an 
acute and persistent shortfall in Rupee reserves. The remedial policy measures 
undertaken to address the Rupee shortfall caused a severe tightening of the credit 
market, which adversely affected private investment and growth in the latter half 
of the Tenth Plan period. The lingering Rupee shortfall and consequent credit 
crunch in the financial system has given rise to major challenges, affecting both 
households and key sectors of the economy, and is expected to spill over into the 
Eleventh Plan period. Managing the rupee shortage is therefore of high priority to 
ensure a sound macroeconomic policy framework for effective implementation of 
the Eleventh Plan.

Achieving the Eleventh Plan goal of “Self-reliance and inclusive green socio-economic 
development” will require a strong macroeconomic framework. Globally, recent 
conventional macroeconomic policies have been geared towards stability through 
inflation targeting and fiscal sustainability. However, there is now an increasing 
consensus that in developing countries macroeconomic frameworks must strike a 
balance between stabilization targets and broader development objectives. While 
stability shall continue to form a cornerstone of macroeconomic objectives since 
it is a necessary condition for the achievement of other objectives, the Eleventh 
Plan shall additionally focus on creating an enabling environment for growth that 
is inclusive and sustainable and leads to self-reliance. Hence, microeconomic 
strategies shall have to be aligned with the macroeconomic objectives. In this 

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

regard, the conditions and strategies to facilitate diversification of the economic 
base, employment-intensive sectors with enormous potential for backward and 
forward linkages shall be explored. To ensure credit is channelled towards such 
purposes priority sector lending shall be adopted. On the fiscal front, efforts to 
enhance the tax base and creation of fiscal space shall be pursued in addition to 
exploring fiscal incentives for economic activities that generate employment and 
are carbon neutral. Finally, the establishment of a Stabilization Fund with multi-
faceted purposes that serve monetary as well as fiscal policy and investment 
objectives shall be explored given the relevance of such mechanisms in resource-
dependent countries.

3.1.1 Real Sector

Despite growth having been lower than forecast in the Tenth Plan, the economy 
rendered a strong performance with real growth rate averaging 8 percent per 
annum over the five years of the Plan. Poverty also declined from 23 percent in 
2007 to 12 percent as of 2012, well beyond the Plan target.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

However, growth continues to be driven largely by government spending and 
investment. The industrial sector continues to be dominated by a few large state 
owned enterprises, mostly under the umbrella of Druk Holding Investments (DHI), with 
the hydropower subsector constituting almost 20 percent of GDP. The manufacturing 
subsector accounts for only one-fifth of the industrial sector output, and is narrowly 
concentrated in food processing and cottage industries. The lack of economic 
diversification has resulted in a situation of high growth rates driven by the hydropower 
sector without a commensurate increase in gainful employment for a rapidly growing 
and educated labour force, which poses significant macroeconomic challenges. 

The aspirations of the Economic Development Policy 2010 and FDI Policy 2010 
aimed at diversification of the economy and fostering a vibrant private sector 
remains largely unfulfilled due to numerous supply side challenges. An ADB28 study 
have revealed that the sophistication level of Bhutan’s exports have remained 
stagnant over the years and that market failures exist, thereby deterring private 
investment. A product space analysis of Bhutan also reveals an inherent difficulty 
in economic diversification because the capabilities used in the current basket of 
products are not easily transferrable to other products. 

This provides a strong rationale for the government to lead efforts towards economic 
diversification and to develop backward and forward linkages in the industrial 
sector. During the Eleventh Plan period, DHI will play a strategic role in exploring 
new products, business models and market strategies. With three new hydropower 
projects expected to begin generation by 2017-18, a key strategy would be to develop 
export oriented power intensive industries by harnessing the availability of cheap 
and reliable power rather than simply exporting electricity as a primary product. 
In this regard, establishing the necessary infrastructure and creating an enabling 
environment will be crucial for success. Initiatives such as RISE (Rapid Investments 
in Selective Enterprises), where end-to-end support will be provided for about five 
select sectors that have potential for vertical integration, value addition and job 
generation will form the cornerstone of the government’s diversification strategy. 

Savings, Investment and Consumption - Although Bhutan’s Gross Domestic Savings 
have displayed a better trend than its South Asian neighbours, the level of savings has 
been inadequate to finance the significantly higher investment rate. A development 
constraints study by the ADB revealed that while Bhutan had a high domestic savings 
rate of 33.7 percent, this was inadequate to support an investment rate of 52.3 percent.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The high level of savings at the national level is also mainly a result of government 
investments and savings of state owned enterprises and is not necessarily a good 
indicator of household savings. Despite the unavailability of data, it can be surmised 
that savings at the household level is low considering the stage of development 
and average disposable income of households. This is also borne out by the fact 
that household final consumption expenditure grew by an average of 11.3 percent 
during 2007-2010, outpacing the GDP growth rate. Key factors for low household 
savings rate in Bhutan include a lack of credible savings instruments and incentives. 

More challenging than the level of savings is the high volatility in the trend of Gross 
Domestic Savings, as is evident from the data for the period 2005-2012 in the table 
below. Savings witnessed the most significant decline in the fiscal year 2008/09 
recording a negative growth of 5.73 percent while its growth peaked in 2010/11 
at 43.17 percent. While such volatility in savings is probably inevitable due to the 
small size of the domestic economy and is linked to the colossal size of public 
investments, it poses a significant macroeconomic policy challenge as savings is a 
key determinant of credit growth and investment. A key issue, therefore, in addition 
to the level of domestic savings is how the savings can be made less volatile, more 
predictable and effectively intermediated through the financial sector to promote 
private investments.

Source: MTFF (July 2013)

Similarly, the high investment rate that has been driving growth also needs to 
be assessed in light of the declining returns to capital that can be attributed to a 
combination of factors such as inefficiencies in spending, high import content of 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

capital investments and the recent surge in investments on roads and hydropower 
for which the returns would only be realized in the future. As is empirically 
observed globally, consumption expenditure has constituted a greater share of 
GDP than investment. However, investment has displayed significant volatility 
which is partly attributable to volatile domestic savings and the colossal size of 
investments relative to GDP. Moreover, hydropower investments thus far have 
been externally financed, with limited contribution of domestic savings. This is 
inevitable in an economy where the public sector is significantly larger than the 
private sector. In comparison to other South Asian economies, Bhutan records the 
highest share of Government consumption and investment as a percentage of GDP 
(ADB, 2012). Government consumption is primarily driven by expenditure incurred 
for the social sectors of health and education and investment is dominated largely 
by hydropower construction and infrastructure.

A positive trend can be observed in that the growth rate of Gross Domestic Capital 
Formation has consistently outpaced the growth rate of consumption. Gross fixed 
capital formation grew annually at 7.2 percent during 2001-2011 and by 12.5 
percent a year since 2007. In comparison to the Ninth Plan Period investment has 
displayed a significantly higher growth rates which reflect the huge investments in 
infrastructure and growth in housing.

The percentage contributions to GDP of the various demand side variables also 
corroborate the high volatility of the components. However, it is encouraging to 
note that despite Gross Domestic Capital Formation constituting a smaller share 
of GDP, its percentage contribution to Nominal GDP growth has been the most 
significant with an average of 12.13 percentage points over the Tenth Plan period.

Empirical evidence suggests that countries achieve a higher level of per capita income 
and higher standards of living through productivity enhancing capital accumulation 
and improvement in total factor productivity. As such, it is necessary to weigh the 
relative returns on different types of capital investments during the Eleventh Plan 
period and how these investments enhance labour and total factor productivity (TFP). 
The Eleventh Plan and EDP 2010 would need to prioritize non-hydropower related 
capital investments to prevent excessive dependence on hydropower, improve 
productivity and competitiveness and facilitate diversification of the economy taking 
into account Bhutan’s potential and dynamic competitive advantages.

Inflation - As the economy has grown and incomes have increased largely due to 
hydropower investments and government development projects, the wealth effect 
and availability of credit has translated into a surge in imports due to increasing 
domestic absorption amid limited domestic production capacity. This has exerted 
huge pressure on the current account and subsequently on our reserves. Given 
limited domestic capacity it is also hypothesized that the Bhutanese economy is 
functioning above its potential output level, putting upward pressures on prices 
and wages and possibly making the real exchange rate over-valued thereby making 
manufacturing export potentially less competitive. Inflation measured by CPI 
averaged about 7.7 percent per annum during the Tenth Plan. The year-on-year 
inflation rate was highest in the 2nd quarter of 2012 recording 13.53 percent and 
since then it has been on the decline.

It is envisaged that highly focused economic initiatives in the Eleventh Plan, which 
include the establishment of a Stabilization Fund, will mitigate the risks of a Dutch 
disease situation in Bhutan and help stabilize the real exchange rate by sterilizing 
inflows and facilitating diversification.

3.1.2 External Sector

Bhutan continues to be a net importer of goods and services. The Tenth Plan period 
witnessed high volatility and a widening of the current account deficit, ranging from 
1.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 27.6 percent in 2010/11, culminating in an acute 
shortage of Indian Rupee (INR) reserves. While exports increased by 30.5 percent 
in the last five years (2008/09 - 2012/13), imports grew by 132 percent during the 
same period mainly due to an increase in import of machinery and other inputs 
for hydropower related construction. Additionally, the rapid expansion of credit for 
consumption has largely translated into imports. 

Although the overall balance of payments position during the Tenth Plan has been 
positive, with successive Capital Account surpluses averaging Nu. 15.6 billion 
annually financing the Current Account deficits, close to 74 percent of the Net 
Capital inflows came in the form of external borrowings. The external sector 
position is expected to deteriorate during the peak construction period of ongoing 
and new hydro power plants. Hence the current trends in external imbalances 

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

need to be assessed in a broader and longer term context of increasing and 
diversifying the export base. The magnitude of the external imbalances is further 
amplified by the small size of the economy and the colossal investments required 
for harnessing hydropower. 

While the longer term outlook of the external sector appears bright given the 
significant increase in export revenues expected with the commissioning of the 
hydro projects, caution needs to be taken and appropriate measures identified 
in the medium term to monitor external financing risks, particularly given the 
alarming increase in short term debt instruments such as the State Bank of India 
(SBI) overdraft and GOI standby credit financing which reached a record INR 45 
billion in 2011/12. Although these short-term debts are liquidated as and when 
there is a corresponding INR inflow, they come at a considerably high interest rate 
of 10 percent. 

A key issue arising from the external imbalances is that of defending the Ngultrum-
INR peg, which is the cornerstone of Bhutan’s monetary policy. This has become 
extremely challenging given the magnitude of the imbalances in recent years which 
have necessitated costly short-term borrowings. As such we need to explore other 
financing instruments to meet external imbalances, fiscal instruments that limit 
the propensity to import to a sustainable level and provide incentives for import 
substitution and export growth. 

The situation of the Bhutanese economy can be illustrated using the twin deficits 
approach. With high investment rates, Gross Domestic Savings have not been 
sufficient to finance investment resulting in a current account deficit. The direction 
of both series has been highly correlated as can be seen from the graph. Similarly 
the fiscal balance which also includes loans availed for hydro power contributed to 
the current account deficit.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Graph 3.4 – Twin Deficit



Source: GNHC (PPD, 2013)

The establishment of a stabilization fund is being explored to address the challenges 
of the external sector by stabilizing the current account imbalances through an 
array of investment activities such as the issuance of INR denominated bonds.

3.1.3 Monetary Sector

The monetary policy environment in Bhutan has come under intense scrutiny with 
the emergence of a chronic INR shortfall and subsequent liquidity crunch in the 
financial system that has severely affected the economy since 2011. This lingering 
problem that has spilled over into the Eleventh Plan has prompted the need for 
monetary policy objectives to be better aligned with the longer term development 
objectives of the country.

Of particular significance in the monetary sector has been the high growth in 
broad money (M2) during the Tenth Plan period, outpacing GDP growth rate by a 
factor of four. The high growth can largely be explained by the surge in short-term 
deposits in the banking system, which in turn contributed to a rapid expansion of 
domestic credit.

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Graph 3.5 – Money Supply



Source: MTFF (July 2013)

This rapid expansion of domestic credit, averaging 32.3 percent annually from 2008 
to 2012, and its composition, has largely translated into imports, thereby exerting 
pressure on the peg and draining of INR reserves. Currently, personal, housing and 
construction loans account for the largest share of credit in the economy, both of 
which invariably lead to imports. The magnitude of the rapid expansion in domestic 
credit can be illustrated from the fact that Bhutan’s domestic credit to GDP ratio 
nearly doubled between 2007 and 2011. Most significantly, within the span of a 
year net domestic credit increased by 176.8 percent, from Nu 6.8 billion in 2008 
to Nu 18.9 billion in 2009. In 2007, Bhutan had the lowest domestic credit to GDP 
ratio in South Asia but has today surpassed that of Sri Lanka or Pakistan. 





Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Central banks typically sterilize inflows or use various types of macro-prudential 
tools to contain excessive credit growth to minimize the destabilizing impact on 
the real economy. 

The decomposition of credit and deposits reveals that banks have borrowed short 
term and lent long term reflecting an asset liability mismatch, which is evident from 
the fact that since 2009 time deposits have stagnated while credit has increased 
significantly. Hence, addressing the current challenges in the monetary sector 
require policy interventions that encourage credit to be channeled to productive 
sectors and incentives to encourage long term savings such as tax exemption on 
interest earnings from time deposits.


Source: ADB (2013)

Another challenge of the monetary sector is that the banking sector is characterized 
by high volatility in its liquidity. For instance, excess liquidity in the system ranged 
from a peak of Nu. 4.5 billion in 2012 to a low of negative Nu. 1.1 billion in 2011. 
The average excess liquidity during the period 2008-2012 was Nu. 2.69 billion but 
the standard deviation was an alarming Nu. 2.04 billion. The volatility coefficient 
for this period was 0.76 implying that the average volatility swung to as high as 76 
percent of the average excess liquidity. This warrants the deployment of monetary 
policy tools to ensure a stable level of liquidity and avoid excess liquidity that can 

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

lead to reckless lending. Moreover, a stable level of liquidity is crucial to promote 
investments by the private sector.

Furthermore, it needs to be verified whether the surge in unsterilized hydro-related 
inflows and other Official Development Assistance inflows through the same logic, 
are sparking off a credit multiplier effect and consequently the growing current 
account deficits and persistent shortfall in the INR reserves. These inflows, which 
ultimately exit the economy after a brief time lag, remain unsterilized; and within 
this short period leads to an expansion of short term deposits that invariably result 
in an expansion of the money supply. In which case, establishing a stabilization 
fund would be critical to effectively sterilizing the large inflows and preventing the 
money multiplier effect in the banking system.

Monitoring credit allocation and ensuring that they are channeled in the right 
direction will be critical to addressing the negative impacts of credit expansion, 
particularly on the external sector. The ADB recommends interim measures that 
target credit demand rather than supply. In this regard, fiscal incentives will play a 
critical role in diverting credit away from non-productive sectors to more productive 
sectors that generate employment and enhance exports. Similarly, a stronger and 
proactive promotion of the capital market is critical to channel the savings of the 
public to more productive purposes. Currently, industries are more inclined to 
borrow at exorbitant interest rates from banks in the absence of incentives for 
capital market listings. Providing fiscal incentives for stock market listings and re-
investment in shares would, in addition to encouraging and channeling savings 
towards productive purposes, also enhance transparency and productivity. The 
UNDESA recommends the adoption of an Asset Based Reserve Requirement system 
to channel credit towards priority sectors. The RMA is already in the process of 
formulating a priority sector lending policy which will provide the much needed 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

impetus to promote exports and employment. Such coordinated measures that 
involve monetary tools and fiscal incentives for financial sector vibrancy are crucial 
to address the current challenges in the monetary sector.

An important aspect of monetary policy in Bhutan involves the management 
of foreign reserves. Convertible currency constitutes close to 90 percent of our 
foreign reserves despite the fact that the major share of our current account 
transactions are denominated in INR with approximately 90 percent of our 
exports and 70 percent of imports being with India. The lingering INR shortfall and 
its effects on the economy provide a compelling argument for a more dynamic 
reserve management system that takes into consideration an appropriate ratio in 
the composition of our reserves between INR and other convertible currencies. 

According to the UNDESA study, holding a sufficient portion of reserves in INR 
would also provide some level of cushioning to address the mismatch in the timing 
of inflows and outflows of INR and thereby avoid a reactive liquidation of USD. The 
study shows that although huge current account deficits surfaced in earlier years, 
no alarm was created because the central bank maintained adequate INR reserves.

3.1.4 Fiscal Sector

The government’s fiscal performance has also come under scrutiny in the wake 
of the INR crunch. It has been argued that excessive spending by the government 
resulted in huge current account deficits and consequently the INR crunch. 
Government spending also leads to a multiplier effect that increases aggregate 
demand and ultimately imports given the limited domestic productive capacity. 
It is felt that the large investments of the government have resulted in an 
overheating of the economy. Amid such concerns there have been calls to tighten 
fiscal spending considering the government’s dominant presence in the economy. 
With government expenditure averaging 39 percent of nominal GDP, and given 
the colossal nature of recent investments such as the Punatsangchu I amounting 
to nearly 100 percent of GDP, such concerns are not without merit. Moreover, the 
concentration of these investments in the same time period has also given rise to 
concerns that they contribute to the liquidity crunch. 

However, the counterargument is that the impact of the government’s expenditure 
on the current account is offset to a large extent by corresponding inflows of aid 
and revenue from hydropower sales. It also needs to be highlighted that the 

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

government’s fiscal approach has been generally prudent with the budget deficit 
never exceeding GDP growth rates. Moreover, curtailing of the government 
investments in much needed public infrastructure and services would undermine 
Bhutan’s pursuit of inclusive growth and sustainable development. Nevertheless, 
various reforms are required to broaden the tax base, rein in unproductive and 
recurrent expenditure and manage the current macroeconomic imbalances.

Enhanced fiscal management will be crucial for a smooth transition away from an 
aid driven economy and to achieve the Eleventh Plan goal of self-reliance. While 
revenue mobilization has been commendable, averaging 23 percent of GDP over 
the Tenth Plan, this falls far short of government expenditure. During the Tenth 
Plan, official development assistance accounted for an average of 14 percent 
of GDP. Bhutan’s improved socio-economic indicators will result in an eventual 
phasing out of aid by development partner for which the government must be 
prepared. Enhancing government revenues to fill in the expected decline in aid will 
be crucial to sustain the high rate of GDP growth.

Given Bhutan’s high level of debt stock of 97 percent of GDP and the rate at which 
it has been increasing, enhanced debt management capabilities will be crucial. 
Although most of the debt thus far has been channeled towards self-liquidating 
hydro investments, the recent surge in short term debt availed to address INR 
liquidity shortages have become a cause for serious concern. 



Source: MTFF (July 2013)

The fiscal deficit during the Eleventh Plan has been targeted at 3 percent of GDP, 
excluding the construction of debt financed hydropower projects. This is far more 
stringent than the 6.75 percent targeted in the Tenth Plan, which is mainly to 
ensure that the government limits deficit financing from the domestic market 

03

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

which is already facing a severe liquidity crunch and also to avoid crowding out of 
private sector investments. 

Alignment of Monetary and Fiscal Policies - The macroeconomic challenges that 
transpired during the Tenth Plan period have highlighted the need for effective 
coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities. For a small open economy 
like Bhutan, such coordination is critical to ensure a stable macroeconomic 
environment through periodic joint assessments of the real, fiscal and monetary 
sectors; formulation of mutually reinforcing preventive measures; and ensuring 
effective remedial measures during times of crisis. The lingering INR crunch has 
brought the importance and need for such coordination to the fore. For instance, 
instead of RMA’s moratoria on various forms of lending to discourage imports, a 
viable policy alternative was the imposition of adequately large taxes, which fiscal 
authorities were politically constrained in imposing. Coherence between monetary 
and fiscal policies is also critical for the smooth implementation of development 
projects. Based on fiscal outlays, monetary authorities need to undertake prudent 
liquidity management to ensure reliable access to credit by the private sector. 
Coordination is also crucial in ensuring the sustainability of the currency peg. Given 
Bhutan’s stage of development, fiscal spending and to a certain extent deficits, 
are critical to deliver growth. Hence a trade-off needs to be arrived at between 
monetary targets and growth priorities. A moderate level of inflation is acceptable 
for Bhutan, given the infrastructure investment requirements and the low level of 
urbanization. 

It is argued that in the case of Bhutan, monetary policy is redundant or has 
minimal leverage given that inflation is largely an exogenous phenomenon due to 
the pegged exchange rate regime. Various studies provide evidence, that the non-
tradable sector has been growing and inflationary pressure has been building in 
the sector, which is mainly a result of monetary and fiscal expansion. Moreover, in 
addition to price stability, central banks, particularly in developing countries, have 
a critical role in maintaining financial system stability, safeguarding the balance 
of external payments and more promoting broader socio-economic development 
goals. 

In facilitating monetary and fiscal policy coordination, the existing Macroeconomic 
Framework Coordination Committee’s (MFCC) responsibilities could be expanded 
to include the following:



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

1. Ensuring efficient exchange of information between key government 
agencies that would improve coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. 
Based on information provided by the MoF, GNHC and MoEA about the 
government’s financing requirements and development activities, RMA 
would suggest appropriate policies that are based on sustainable monetary 
and external position of the economy;
2. Assessment of the availability of credit/liquidity by RMA to ensure 
smooth implementation of development projects by the private sector 
which is dependent on credit. Deliberate and analyze the results of the 
Government’s cash balance projections;
3. Deliberate and formulate strategies and policies for achieving public debt 
and monetary management objectives. (UNESCAP, 2009).


In this regard the MFCC needs to be strengthened in order to meet the above 
mentioned objectives and serve as a competent economic advisory body that 
ensures convergence of diverse policies to achieve broader national goals. Given 
the pace of economic growth and increasing macroeconomic challenges a business 
as usual approach will further jeopardize the health of the economy.

 3.2 Macro-economic outlook

3.2.1 Real Sector Outlook

GDP Growth Projections - Real GDP is projected to increase by an average of close 
to 12 percent per annum, with the electricity sector driving most of the growth. 
This is based on the assumption that the hydro power projects in the pipe line 
are completed as scheduled. The real GDP growth rate is expected to spike to 
17.36 and 24 per cent towards the end of the plan period, driven primarily by the 
industry sector, which is expected to grow by 30.8 percent and 42.5 percent in the 
last two years of the Plan due to the commissioning of three mega projects. The 
services sector is expected to sustain consistent growth rates averaging about 9 
percent per annum, primarily fuelled by tourism and the expanding non-tradable 
sector. The growth in the primary sector is expected to remain moderate, at less 
than 2 percent per annum. 

While the projections show a very optimistic growth scenario, the macroeconomic 
challenges of recent years underscores the need to prudently address various issues 
in the real, external and monetary sectors. Given the huge revenue gains expected 
from the hydropower sector, there is also a growing imperative for preventive 
measures against the phenomenon of ‘Dutch disease”. In this regard, the prudent 
management and use of hydropower inflows towards an effective strategy for 
economic diversification, productivity enhancement through knowledge and skills 
development and employment creation will be critical.

3.2.2 External Sector Outlook

The external sector is expected to worsen with the current account balance 
averaging around -28 percent of GDP. It is expected to reach a low of -34.7 percent 

03

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

of GDP largely on account of hydropower construction imports. However, except 
for the first year of the plan (2013/14), it is projected that the capital and financial 
account balance will be sufficient to finance the current account deficit. Despite 
exports projected to increase by 192 percent by the end of the Eleventh Plan 
coinciding and largely on account of the commissioning of the 3 new hydropower 
projects, imports will also increase by 107 percent. This needs to be assessed in light 
of the significantly larger base of the import value which will increase consistently 
every year implying that the trade deficit is expected to worsen. 



Source: MTFF (July 2013)

External borrowing will continue to be the dominant source of financing the Current 
Account deficit, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all inflows. Hydro 
grants will constitute 33 percent and FDI 5 percent of all inflows. The contribution 
of FDI to the capital account is projected to decline in the Eleventh Plan, despite 
the increase in its absolute value during the last years of the Plan. As highlighted 
earlier these inflows will not be able to finance the deficit for the five year period.

Gross international reserves are projected to improve from USD 627.9 million as of 
2011/12 to USD 1,049.5 million by 2017/18. This will be sufficient to cover around 
20 months of essential imports.

While deterioration in the Current Account deficit is mainly attributable to 
investments in the hydro power sector, the debt for which are self-servicing once 
projects are commissioned, the following issues are a matter of concern:

• National savings are not adequate to finance the level of investment in the 
economy. Hence, external borrowing is inevitable. However, the deterioration 
of the current account is not only attributable to rising investment but also 
due to declining savings. A recent study by ADB notes that GDS plummeted to 
16.1 percent of GDP in 2008 due to the financial crisis, but started to recover 
in 2009 and 2010, yet they are still below pre-crisis levels. 
• Heavy dependence on foreign financing of current account creates 
economic vulnerabilities. Export promotion and import substitution 
policies are expected to release pressure on Balance of Payments.
• Dwindling Reserves are not only likely to fall short of statutory requirements 
of 12 months of essential import, but may also fail to keep pace with market 
demand thus triggering further short term borrowing or exacerbating 
pressure on the exchange rate peg. Hence alternative short term financing 
mechanisms need to be explored.

3.2.3 Fiscal Outlook (without hydropower debt servicing)

Fiscal projections presented exclude hydropower debt servicing in order to provide 
a clearer overview of the financial transactions of the Eleventh Plan programmes. 

The fiscal projections have been framed to ensure that the current expenditures 
are covered through domestic revenues; critical capital investments are either 
financed through surplus domestic revenues, grants from development partners 
or highly concessional loans from multilateral institutions; capital investments 
activities that have potential for public private partnerships are excluded from the 
capital outlay; and fiscal deficit is kept below a prudent level averaging 3 percent 
of GDP over the five year period. 

Based on the above, the Eleventh Plan expenditure outlay is estimated to be 
around Nu. 213 billion, of which current expenditure is Nu.121 billion and capital 
expenditure of Nu.92 billion. Resources are projected at Nu. 198 billion, comprising 
of domestic revenues of Nu.140 billion and external grants of Nu.58 billion. As 
such, a fiscal deficit of Nu. 15 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, is projected.

Expenditure Outlay - In contrast to past plans, where plan size more than doubled on 
a plan-to-plan basis, the Eleventh Plan outlay is projected to increase by 40 percent. 
The current expenditure is projected to increase by 63 percent, which is mainly due to 
increase in personal emoluments28 which constitutes about 45 percent of total current 
expenditure; increased cost of infrastructure maintenance due to past investments in 
schools, hospitals and roads; and increased interest payment obligations. 

The capital expenditure is projected to increase by about 24 percent over that 
of the Tenth Plan, mainly on account of investments in roads, health, education, 
urban development, culture and human resource development. The increase is 
significantly lower than that of the Tenth Plan as the emphasis in the Eleventh Plan 
is on consolidation and sustainability. Secondly, considering the current economic 
situation, capital expenditure has been kept relatively small to prevent further 
deterioration in the trade imbalances.

Resources - Resources are projected to increase by about 32 percent over that of the 
Tenth Plan. Of the total resources, 70 percent are domestic revenues and 30 percent 
are grants. Domestic resources are projected to increase by 55 percent, with the 
major increases occurring in the final year of the Plan with the commissioning of 
Punatsangchhu I, Punastangchu II and Mangdechhu hydro-power projects. 

Grants are projected to increase by 13 percent over that of the Tenth Plan, mainly 
on account of increase in Government of India’s assistance from Nu. 34 billion to 
Nu.45 billion. The overall level of assistance from other development partners is 
projected to decline as a result of phasing out of assistance by some partners.

Against the targeted fiscal deficit ceiling of less than 3 percent of GDP over the 
plan period, a fiscal deficit of Nu. 15 billion or 2 % of GDP is projected. The deficit 
will be covered through concessional borrowings mainly from World Bank, Asian 
Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development and Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) loans. 

Indicative Planning Figures - From the total outlay of Nu. 213 billion, 71 percent 
is allocated to the central agencies and 29 percent to the local governments. The 
allocation projected for local governments does not include provisions for targeted 
poverty interventions programmes, capital investments plans for local government 
education sector and recurrent expenditure for Thromdes. These have been 
budgeted under central agencies allocation.

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK

28Increase in pay and allowance due to increase in the number of civil servants and the proposed 
pay and allowance revisions in the Eleventh Plan. In the Tenth Plan, civil service grew by about 4 
percent annually and the same growth trend is projected.

3.2.4 Fiscal Sector Outlook (with hydropower debt servicing)

Accounting for hydropower inflows and outflows for debt servicing, the projections 
for recurrent expenditure, domestic revenue, net lending and repayment are more 
optimistic as follows:

1. The recurrent expenditure and domestic revenue are expected to increase 
by about Nu. 11 billion. Interest received on account of hydropower is 
recorded as revenue at the time of receipt by the Ministry of Finance and 
booked as current expenditure when the interest is repaid to the lender. 
When hydropower operations are included in the fiscal projections, domestic 
revenues are projected to increase by about 67 percent as compared to 
55 percent when hydropower is excluded, thereby inflating the level of 
revenue projections. Similar increases in recurrent expenditure and the total 
expenditure are projected. 
2. With recoveries from hydropower projects exceeding lending, the net 
lending projections present a favourable fiscal space with a fiscal deficit of 
just Nu. 112 million against a projection of Nu. 15 billion without hydropower 
operations, creating artificial fiscal space.


Inclusion of hydropower debt servicing obligations presents a more favourable fiscal 
outlook as the fiscal deficit falls. The main implications here are that overall, the 
debt stock composition will change with INR debt being replaced by concessional 
borrowings.

3.2.5 Public Debt Stock 

The total public debt stock is expected to increase from Nu. 110 billion in 2013/14 
to Nu.259 billion in 2017/18, an increase of about 135 percent, by the end of the 
Plan. Public debt stock is comprised of 99 percent external borrowings and 1 
percent domestic borrowings. Hydro-power debt is expected to account for 80 
percent of the total public debt stock, most of which is denominated in INR. The 
borrowings for hydro-power projects are estimated to increase by 184 percent from 
Nu. 73 billion to Nu. 206 billion. Non-hydro borrowings are projected to increase 
by 36 percent from Nu. 37 billion to Nu. 50 billion, and mainly used for critical 
infrastructure investments projects in roads, electrification, urban development 
and agriculture sectors.

MACRO-ECONOMIC SITUATION AND OUTLOOK



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

121 percent of GDP by the end of the Plan, the government’s ability to repay its 
obligation has also been improving. Despite the high level of public debt stock and 
associated debt indictors, Bhutan debt stock may be classified as sustainable since 
80 percent of the debt are for self-liquidating hydro-power projects. The public 
debt stock projections for the Eleventh Plan are as follows:

4.1 Eleventh Plan Objective

With the long term vision of GNH in sight, the government shall in the Eleventh 
Plan focus on Self Reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-economic Development. 

The rationale for such an aspiration is motivated by an understanding of Bhutan’s 
current situation and priorities and its alignment to the GNH based development 
path. The first element of self-reliance is crucial in many dimensions: First, our 
economy while achieving robust growth rates over the last decade is still import 
driven, has a narrow tax base that is largely dependent on hydropower revenues 
and low levels of productive employment though the overall unemployment rates 
reported is commendable. Secondly, with the improved socio-economic indicators, 
some of our traditional development partners have already indicated their desire 
to phase out development assistance from Bhutan. Hence the urgency to pursue 
the self-reliance objective that transforms our economy to a more diversified 
economy that creates productive employment opportunities, ensures a broader 
tax base and provides an enabling environment for private sector development. 
Self-reliance is interpreted as the “ability to meet all our national development 
needs as articulated through 5 Year Plans by 2020”.

The second element of Inclusive Development refers to “reducing poverty and 
inequality by enhancing the standard of living and the quality of life of the most 
vulnerable sections of our society”. While our poverty and social indicators report 
significant progress, disparities exist within regions, area of residence and gender. 
The Eleventh Plan will ensure inclusiveness by targeting the disadvantaged and 
vulnerable sections of our population so that all sections of our population enjoy 
the benefits of socio-economic development. 

As in the past plans, an important cross cutting principle shall be the continued 
adoption of rigorous environmental standards in the pursuit of our development 
objectives. Hence the plan shall ensure the mainstreaming and incorporation of 
Green or Carbon Neutral strategies in all our activities. 

4.2 National Key Result Areas (NKRAs)/Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) 

National Key Result Areas (NKRAs) are outcomes at the national level that the 
government needs to achieve over the next five years in order to realize the Eleventh 
Plan objective of “Self Reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-Economic Development”.

ELEVENTH PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Sixteen NKRAs have been identified based on the four pillars of GNH. All central 
agencies and local governments contribute towards delivery of the 16 NKRAs 
through their respective Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs), and Dzongkhag Key 
Result Areas (DKRAs). The performance is monitored through clear measurable 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the national, sector and local government 
levels. 

4.2.1 Sustainable and equitable socio-economic development

The key result areas under this pillar are sustained economic growth, reduce 
poverty and achieve MDG Plus targets, food secure and sustained and ensure full 
employment. The KPIs are as follows:

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The KPIs for NKRA 1 - Sustained Economic Growth – are as follows:

i) Annual average GDP growth rate sustained - over the five year period the 
target is to achieve growth rate of 10 percent or more from about 8 percent 
in 2012;
ii) Percentage of domestic financing to total expenditure enhanced – 
Currently, about 60 to 65 percent of the total expenditure is funded 
through domestic revenues. The target is to increase domestic financing to 
total expenditure to 85 percent or more by 2017-18. The present Eleventh 
Plan fiscal projections indicate coverage of about 75 percent in 2017-18, 
with expenditure projections of Nu. 60 billion against domestic revenue 
projections of Nu. 45 billion. For additional 10 percent, efforts to enhance 
domestic revenue or rationalize expenditures (particularly recurrent) will 
be necessary. 
iii) Annual average fiscal deficit over the plan period sustained – In the past 
plans, the annual average fiscal deficit of 5-6 percent of GDP was projected. 
In the Tenth Plan, fiscal deficit of Nu. 15.193 billion or 6.76 percent of GDP 
was projected against which the actual outcome was an average of 0.3 
percent of GDP over a five year period. In the Eleventh Plan, average fiscal 
deficit of less than 3 percent of GDP is projected considering the present 
economic situation and to avoid crowding out of private sector borrowings 
from domestic financial institutions. 
iv) Consumer Price Index sustained – inflation, measured in terms of consumer 
price index, is targeted to be maintained around 7-8 percent over the 
Eleventh Plan period. 
v) Priority sector lending enhanced – This KPI was identified to ensure lending 
to productive sectors. The target will be decided based on the priority 
sectors to be identified by the government. 
vi) Exports without electricity increased – Exports without electricity will be 
tracked to enhance economic diversification. Accordingly, the target is to 
double exports without electricity from Nu. 15 billion in 2012 to Nu. 28 
billion by 2017-18.

ELEVENTH PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The KPIs for NKRA 2 – Poverty Reduced and MDG Plus Achieved – are as follows:

i) Income poverty reduced – The income poverty will be reduced from 12 
percent in 2012 to less than 5 percent by 2017-18.
ii) Multidimensional poverty reduced – With data on multidimensional 
poverty now being available, poverty reduction will also be tracked on 
multidimensional basis (health, education and living standards). The target 
will be to reduce multidimensional poverty from 25.8 percent to less than 
10 percent by 2018. 
iii) Gini-coefficient reduced - will be used to monitor inequalities. The target 
is to reduce from 0.36 in 2012 to 0.3 by 2017-18. Gini-coefficient usually 
ranges from 0.2 to 0.5. Even the most equal countries like Norway, Denmark, 
Sweden and Finland have a Gini coefficient of about 0.24 to 0.26. 
iv) MDG Plus achieved indicators are for the health and education sectors. In 
the area of health, the targets are to significantly reduce infant mortality 
rate, under five mortality rate, maternal mortality rates, incidence of 
tuberculosis and malaria and improve coverage of clean drinking water 
and improved sanitation. In the education sector, the main focus will be 
to ensure gender parity at tertiary levels, as Bhutan has already achieved 
the target for gender parity at primary and secondary school levels. The 
target set is at least 90 percent from the current 71 percent female to male 
in tertiary education. In terms of school enrollment rates the target is to 
achieve close to 100 percent by 2018. 
v) In addition to the above KPIs, poverty reduction will also be assessed based 
on the GNH Index. The quality of housing and household per capita income 
reported by the GNH Index will be tracked. 


The KPIs for NKRA 3 – Food Secure and Sustained – are as follows:

i) Cereal self-sufficiency enhanced - Cereal sufficiency will be enhanced from 64 
percent in 2011 to 75 percent by 2017-18. Disaggregated targets for production 
of rice, maize, wheat etc are kept under RNR Sector’s key result areas. 
ii) Milk sufficiency enhanced – The target is to increase from 90 percent in 
2011 to 100 percent sufficiency.




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

iii) Stunting reduced – The Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010 reports 
prevalence of moderate and severe stunting among 33.5 percent of the 
children under five, a reflection of chronic malnutrition. The critical window 
for a child’s optimal physical and mental growth and development is the 
first 33 months, from the time it is in its mother’s womb (9 months) and till 
it reaches two years of life. Thereafter, it is irreversible and stunted children 
grow up to be stunted adults with reduced physical and cognitive capacity. 
This could lead to poor health, impaired educational attainment, reduced 
work productivity and lower wage earning potential throughout one’s life.


The target for the Eleventh Plan is to reduce stunting from 33.5 percent in 
2010 to less than 30 percent by 2017-18.

The causes for chronic malnutrition are many and complex, therefore multi-
sectoral coordinated efforts will be vital to address the issue, particularly 
that of the Ministries of Agriculture and Forest, Health, and Education. 

The KPIs for NKRA 4 – Full Employment – are as follows:

i) Full employment achieved - The target is to ensure full employment defined 
as employment of 97.5 percent or unemployment of 2.5 percent. The 
baseline is higher than the plan target as unemployment in 2012 was 2.1 
percent below the definition of full employment. 
ii) Youth unemployment reduced - Among the unemployed, youth 
unemployment is high at 7.3 percent in 2012. The target is to ensure full 
employment to youth or reduce youth unemployment from 7.3 percent in 
2012 to 2.5 percent by 2018.
iii) Percentage of regular paid employee increased - Labour Force Survey 2012 
reports that only 23.9 percent of those employed fall under the regular paid 
employee status. Further, females under this category are much lower at 
6.1 percent as compared to males (17.8 percent). The target is to increase 
the proportion of regular paid employees to about 40 percent. This is an 
ambitious target but needs to be pursued to ensure income, social security 
and gender equality. 
iv) Long term/chronic unemployment reduced – long term or chronic 
unemployment is normally defined as unemployment lasting for longer 


04

ELEVENTH PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

than one year (EU Statistics) or 27 months (United States Bureau of Labor 
Statistics). In Bhutan, some of the unemployed choose to remain voluntary 
unemployed, particularly youth, till they get the job of their choice due 
to strong social support of family and relatives. Therefore, the target is to 
track those actively looking for work but have remained unemployed over 
a longer period of time. However, due to lack of data the target is yet to 
be decided. Data on chronic unemployment will be collected and tracked 
during the Eleventh Plan. 


4.2.2 Preservation and promotion of culture

The key result areas under this pillar are strengthened Bhutanese identity, social 
cohesion and harmony and indigenous wisdom, arts and crafts promoted for 
sustainable livelihoods. The KPIs are as follows:

– target is to increase from 6.6 percent to 12 percent by end of the plan 
period. 
ii) Ecological footprint sustained – is an accounting tool that measures how 
much biologically productive land and sea is used by a given population 
or activity, and compares this to how much land and sea is available. The 
target over the next five years is to conduct a study to establish a baseline 
and target for the future. 
iii) Population Status of umbrella species (Tiger) maintained –The richness of 
prey species determines the health of ecosystem. The umbrella species 
used is tiger population and the target is to maintain 155 numbers.


Water has been given special focus in the Eleventh Plan in view of its importance 
for the basic survival of all living beings and for our hydroelectric projects and 
agriculture. According to the Bhutan Environment Outlook 2008, Bhutan has the 
one of the world’s highest per capita availability of water with long-term mean 
annual flow estimated at 73,000 million m3 per annum and the per capita water 
availability estimated at 100,000 m3. However, shortage of drinking water is a major 
problem in many Dzongkhags and towns. The National Environment Commission 
is conducting the first ever water resource inventory in the country to assess the 
state of water availability and water sources. The findings from the assessment will 
be incorporated and the KPIs for water security updated in the course the Plan. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The performance under NKRA 9 – Water Security – will be assessed through the 
following 3 KPIs.

i) 24 hour availability of drinking water ensured – The target is to ensure all 
settlements have 100 percent water supply 24 hours a day.
ii) Ambient Water quality maintained – The baseline is 2010 national 
standards. Currently, besides dissolved oxygen, other parameters of pH, 
Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Conductivity, Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(BOD), T. Coliform, F. Coliform, Lead, Arsenic and copper are also tested in 
the lab to monitor the quality of water. The target is to increase parameters 
of total hardness, ammonia and oil grease, which are very important for 
monitoring industries and automobile workshops.
iii) Long term mean annual flow of the entire country sustained – Based on 
studies carried out in 2002 by the Department of Energy and NorConsult 
for preparation of Water Resources Management Plan the long term mean 
annual flow of the entire country was estimated to be 73,000 million m³. 
The target is to maintain mean annual flow and be a reflection of our efforts 
particularly in watershed management.


The KPIs for NKRA 10 – Improved Disaster Resilience and Management 
Mainstreamed – are as follows:

i) Number of disaster response teams trained and equipped in Disaster 
Management increased - Currently there is one national search and rescue 
team (NaSRT) the target is to institute one search and rescue team in all 20 
Dzongkhags. 
ii) Response time enhanced (number of hours within which emergency 
response time reaches site of disaster) – the target is to respond within 2 
hours of disaster. 


4.2.4 Good Governance

The key result areas under this pillar are improved public service delivery, democracy 
and governance strengthened, gender friendly environment for women’s 
participation, corruption reduced, safe society and the needs of vulnerable groups

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The KPIs for NKRA 15 – Safe Society – are as follows:

i) Nationwide reported crime (annually) by category, age group and gender 
reduced – currently crime reported is 7 per 1,000 population, the target is 
to bring it down to 5 per 1,000 population.
ii) Percentage of people who feel safe sustained – The indicator is adopted 
from the GNH Index 2010. The target is to sustain at 81 percent or more.


The KPIs for NKRA 16 – Needs of Vulnerable Group Addressed – are as follows:

i) Establishment of baselines and targets for emerging issues – Carry out a 
comprehensive study to determine baselines and targets for emerging 
issues.


Currently, there is no agency within the government catering to the needs 
of the small but growing numbers of vulnerable people. Therefore, the 
government will be partnering closely with relevant CSOs to realize this 
national key result area. 

The 16 NKRAs have been formulated based on the four pillars of GNH to ensure 
that development is holistic and sustainable and other important aspects of 
development such as our cultural, environment and good governance are not 
compromised in pursuit social and economic development. Therefore, cross-
cutting issues like gender, environment, disaster management, climate resilient 
development, poverty, culture and governance have all been identified as national 
key result areas in the Eleventh Plan. 

4.3 Sector and Dzongkhag Key Result Areas (SKRAs/DKRAs)/
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

To achieve the 16 NKRAs, Sector Key Result Areas (SKRAs) and Dzongkhag Key 
Result Areas (DKRAs) with their respective KPIs have been defined for each sector 
and Dzongkhag. These have also been formulated based on the four pillars of 
GNH to ensure that all sectors contribute towards strengthening them. The SKRAs, 
DKRAs and their KPIs, will be the basis for monitoring the performance of various 
sectors and local governments in the Eleventh Plan. They are discussed in detail 
under Chapters 5 and 6 on sector and local government plans respectively.

4.4 Strategic Thrust Areas 

Towards achieving the NKRAs and KPIs, the main strategic thrust will be on i) 
inclusive social development, ii) accelerated green economic development and iii) 
strategic infrastructure development. 

4.4.1 Inclusive Social Development 

While at the national level our poverty and social indicators have improved 
significantly, disparities exist among Dzongkhags, Gewogs, gender and area of 
residence. To ensure regional balance and equity, inclusive social development has 
been identified as one of the thrust areas. 

The main focus of this thrust area will be to further reduce poverty both in terms 
of income and multidimensional poverty, address emerging social issues (issues 
related to the elderly, youth, single parents, differently-abled persons, safety etc.), 
and improving social outcomes.

The key performance indicators for this thrust area are Poverty Reduction 
and Millennium Development Goals Plus (MDG +), with targets comparable 
to those of developed countries. Other indicators include income poverty and 
multidimensional poverty reduction targets; gini-coefficient target to measure 
inequalities and improved health and education targets. The targets, wherever 
feasible and relevant, will be monitored at disaggregated levels (such as by region, 
area of residence, and gender) to ensure inclusiveness. 

Ensuring inclusive development requires that we overcome weaknesses in our 
current broad based national level programmes that often miss out the most 
vulnerable and isolated sections of our population. As such, the key programmes 
for inclusive social development are:

• Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) seeks to target extreme 
poverty in rural areas by identifying the poorest and remote villages, 
which will otherwise not be addressed through broad-based development 
programmes. The focus is on securing sustainable livelihoods through 
programmes that emphasize diversifying crop cultivation to enhance food 
security and nutritional intake, generating supplementary income through 
skills development in non-farm livelihood activities, and building social 
capital through formation of self-help groups for mutual collaboration.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The beneficiary villages were selected based on the village poverty profile 
submitted by the Dzongkhags. The targeted poverty intervention programme 
is formulated based on the socio-economic surveys of the village carried out 
by the GNHC. REAP Phase I was implemented during the Tenth Plan where 
targeted support was provided to the villages of Thangdokha, Dramekha 
and Ngatsena in Haa; Sanu Dungtoe in Samtse, Mandokha and Choleykha 
in Chhukha; Lopokha (additional villages of Shoba, Nazhina, Lawa, Lamga, 
Megteyna, Samthang and Rukha under Athang Gewog benefited under the 
eco-tourism activities) in Wangduephodrang; Lauri in Samdrupjongkhar; 
Ungar in Lhuentse; Samcholing in Trongsa; Reti in Sarpang; Lamtang in 
Zhemgang and Pam & Chaibi in Mongar. An evaluation of REAP I is currently 
being conducted and will inform the next phase of REAP II which will be 
implemented in the Eleventh plan. About 109 poorest villages have been 
identified across all twenty Dzongkhags. At the same time, efforts are being 
made to identify and formulate special poverty alleviation interventions for 
all the households living under the poverty line.
• National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP) is a programme initiated and 
spearheaded by the Office of Gyalpoi Zimpon in collaboration with a 
number of government agencies. The main objective of the programme is to 
reduce poverty by enhancing the productive asset base of the beneficiaries 
through provision of adequate land, transitional & livelihood support and 
socio-economic facilities.


The beneficiaries include the landless and socio-economically disadvantaged 
groups. Under the programme, the beneficiaries are provided with a 
minimum of 0.5 acres of land as residential land and a maximum of 5 
acres (including residential land) depending on criteria such as: family 
size; number of domicile members; number of able bodied persons; land 
capability; distance to urban centre; and type of urban centre. In addition, 
transition support such as temporary shelter, essential food supplies in 
the initial phase of resettlement, agricultural inputs, health and education 
services, income generating support for sustainable livelihoods and housing 
construction support are provided. 

The programme was initiated in the Tenth Plan and till date NRP at 
Khenadrang, Pemagatshel with 44 households has been completed. 
Rehabilitation programme at Nye, Lhuentse (55 households); Bebji, Haa 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

(83 households); Borangmo, Nganglam (51 households) and Dawathang, 
Samdrup Jongkhar (31 households) are ongoing while feasibility studies 
and planning for Serzhong (Tsirang) and Tanzama (Nganglam) respectively, 
have been initiated. 

• Local Government Empowerment Programme (LGEP) to enhance decision making 
capacity and improve service delivery through provision of essential equipment, 
machinery, Nu. 2 million per year per Gewog and other common resources.
• Special Programme for vulnerable groups – caters to the needs of 
vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, single parents, differently-abled 
persons, and vulnerable children and youth. A study will be conducted 
to determine the baselines and targets based on which appropriate 
interventions will be formulated.
• Targeted Health and Education Interventions - to improve health and 
education outcomes, including through innovative mechanisms to reach 
the unreached, will be developed for Dzongkhags with poor health and 
education outcomes. Rationalization and consolidation of education 
facilities will be explored to improve teacher to pupil ratio, educational 
facilities, address issues of informal boarding and for optimum utilization 
of resources. Similarly, in the health sector, programmes to reduce waiting 
time by improving doctor to patient ratio, improving medical facilities, and 
enhance the use of IT enabled services will be pursued. 


4.4.2 Green Accelerated Economic Development 

Our economy is predominantly driven by the hydropower sector, is highly aid 
dependent and heavily reliant on imports for both consumption and capital goods 
needs. The government continues to play the role of “provider” rather than 
“enabler” due to a small and underdeveloped private sector despite more than 
two decades of “private sector development as an engine of economic growth” 
slogan. Therefore, the emphasis of this thrust area will be economic diversification 
with a focus on development of non-hydropower sectors and fostering the growth 
of a dynamic private sector that catalyzes a transition to a green economy. Key 
attributes of a green economy include low carbon emissions, efficient and 
sustainable resource use, and socially inclusive economic growth and investments, 
which are closely aligned with our development planning framework. 

04

ELEVENTH PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The performance under this thrust area will be broadly assessed against the 
achievement of the Eleventh Plan goal of Self-Reliance as defined above. Key 
performance indicators to gauge our performance under this thrust area include 
annual economic growth, fiscal deficit, inflation, priority sector lending, exports, 
employment, food self-sufficiency and total expenditure financed through domestic 
revenue. However, in keeping with international best practices, these indicators will be 
adjusted using the GNH Policy Screening tool, GNH Index and Strategic Environment 
Assessments (SEAs) to incorporate broader environmental and social criteria which 
are critical for achieving the objective of a transition to a green economy.

The main programmes for this thrust area include:

• Economic Stimulus Programme- Economic Stimulus Programme of Nu. 5 
billion will be implemented to inject liquidity in the financial institutions to 
address the present credit crunch problems and make finances available 
for productive sectors. 
• Rapid Investment in Selected Enterprises (RISE) Programme – The flagship 
programme to accelerate economic growth and achieve the objective of 
self reliance will be the RISE programme. The Government, in consultation 
with the relevant stakeholders, will identify 4-5 non-hydro priority sectors 
for end-to-end intervention in the Eleventh Plan. The selection of priority 
sectors will be based on three filters of i) employment generation, ii) revenues 
to the government, and iii) returns to the entrepreneurs. Tentatively, the 
sectors identified are tourism, agro-processing, construction, small and 
cottage industries including cultural industries such as textiles, arts and 
crafts and manufacturing/mining. 
. The focus of Tourism sector will be to achieve higher yields per 
tourist as well as double the arrivals but spread across the country 
and throughout the calendar year. The initiative will emphasize 
on strengthening tourism governance, developing new products, 
facilitating development of tourist infrastructure/amenities in south, 
central and eastern Bhutan and aggressive destination promotion and 
marketing with the aim of ensuring at least 20 percent of the tourists 
visit eastern part of the country. 
. The emphasis will be on developing Agro-processing industries 
particularly cottage, small and medium type industries aimed at 
improving farmers’ income, import substitution and export promotion, 
promoting commercial farming and employment. 







Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

. The interventions will be directed towards making Construction 
sector an attractive sector for employment. With seven new mega 
hydroelectric projects scheduled to start construction in the Eleventh 
Plan, the sector provides an excellent opportunity to realize the goal 
of full employment. However, many of these jobs are manual in nature 
and currently filled by foreign workers as Bhutanese youth prefer white 
collar jobs. Therefore, efforts to mechanize the construction industry, 
improve working conditions and facilitate better remunerations 
through initiatives that enhance productivity (such as specialization, 
multi-skilling and multi-tasking) will be pursued to attract more youth to 
seek jobs in the construction sector. In addition, improving the quality 
of construction industry through innovative construction technology, 
promoting use of local materials to reduce imports of construction 
materials and capacity strengthening of local construction industries to 
participate in large infrastructure projects will be undertaken.
. With the aim to provide a platform for the promotion and preservation 
of our cultural identity and an alternate source of livelihood especially 
for the rural communities the development of Small and Cottage 
Industries including Cultural industries will be promoted. The focus 
will be on creating an enabling environment such as access to finance, 
starting a business, raw material availability and market. The support in 
terms of product development, quality assurance and capacity building 
of artisans and craftsmen in textiles and arts and crafts will be provided. 
. To accelerate economic diversification, promote exports and 
generate employment opportunities, sustainable development of the 
manufacturing and mining sector will be prioritized. Efforts to improve 
the climate for doing business will be intensified through legislation and 
policy support. Addressing issues such as access to finance particularly 
for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), excise refund, credit rating 
for Bhutan, reduction in turn-around-time for Government to Business 
(G2B) services and development of capital markets will be given priority. 
Development of strategic infrastructure such as dry ports, industrial 
parks, and improving air transport will be accelerated. 





Further, to maximize the benefits of additional firm power that will be 
available with the commissioning of three new hydropower projects 
towards the end of the Eleventh Plan and to enhance scale and 

04

ELEVENTH PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

competitiveness of our products as well as to ensure it is clean and 
green, the establishment of large industries will be explored instead of 
large number of small manufacturing companies. 

A detailed blue print of interventions will be developed with clear 
initiatives, time line, targets, resource requirements and persons 
accountable to deliver the initiatives. The implementation of the 
programme will be rigorously monitored by the Cabinet and Committee 
of Secretaries and problem solving sessions facilitated to expedite 
smooth implementation of the programme. 

• Optimizing Opportunities of Accelerated Hydropower Development – With 
three new hydropower projects under construction and seven new projects 
scheduled to start construction during the Eleventh Plan there are ample 
economic, social and environmental opportunities offered by accelerated 
development of hydropower projects. The economic opportunities such 
as enhancing the local trade and commerce, greater participation of 
Bhutanese private sector, greater employment opportunities, aligning 
of project’s environmental and corporate social responsibilities with the 
community’s needs and the local government’s plans will be optimized. 
• Enabling environment – The enabling environment for businesses will 
be improved through simplification of procedures; enhancing efficiency 
in reviewing, streamlining and enforcing legislation, policies, rules and 
regulations; and facilitating infrastructure investments such as surface and 
air transport, dry ports and industrial parks. 


4.4.3 Strategic Infrastructure Development 

To complement efforts under inclusive development and green accelerated 
economic development, the thrust area on strategic infrastructure development 
will focus on developing economic, social and cultural infrastructures which are 
critical to achieving the Eleventh Plan goals and objectives. 

The overall key performance indicator for this thrust area will be Balanced Regional 
Development, which is to ensure that development is spread equitably across the 
country. Some of the major activities include:

• Urban infrastructure – With the aim of boosting socio-economic 
development in the eastern region and to provide alternatives to Thimphu 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

and Phuentsholing for rural-urban migration, the development of up to 2 
regional hubs (tentatively Kanglung and Nganglam) will be explored. The 
location of a regional hub is based on a set of criteria that includes economic 
potential, existing socio-economic facilities, land availability, and water. 
Besides regional hubs, focus will be on improving urban infrastructure 
facilities and services (water supply in particular) in Dzongkhag headquarters 
and towns and development of human settlement plans based on the 
concept of green cities and valley planning. 
• Transport infrastructure – Under transport infrastructure, construction and 
improvement of national highways, road connectivity to hydropower projects, 
blacktopping of selected Gewog Connectivity (GC) roads, strengthening of 
air transport facilities and feasibility of alternate modes of transport such as 
ropeways, railways and waterways will be explored. 
• Communication infrastructure – The focus will be on strengthening the ICT 
infrastructure facilities such as national data centre, government intranet 
system, fibre optic connectivity and facilities for G2C, G2G and G2B services. 
• Energy infrastructure – includes the accelerated development of 10,000 
MW of hydropower, construction of transmission lines and substations, 
and expansion of rural electrification.
• Economic infrastructure – To facilitate private sector development, economic 
infrastructure such as the dry ports in Phuentsholing and Jigmeling/Nganglam 
and four industrial parks (Bondeyma in Mongar Dzongkhag, Dhandhum in 
Samtse Dzongkhag, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar Dzongkhag and Jigmeling 
in Sarpang Dzongkhag) will be developed.
• Social/Cultural infrastructure – Schools, hospitals, institutions and important 
historical and cultural monuments will be renovated, reconstructed and 
constructed. Some of the major educational infrastructure includes 
school consolidation, Centenary Institute of Education etc. Under health 
new hospitals in Gelephu, Samtse, Thimphu, Deothang and Tsirang will 
be constructed. The cultural infrastructure includes reconstruction/
construction of Dzongs in Wangdue Phodrang, Trashigang, Sarpang, 
Pemagatshel, Gasa, Lingzhi, Paro Ta Dzong and Phajoding Lhakang. Besides, 
Anim Shedra in Gyelposhing, two new Zhirim Lobdras and construction of 
Tango Buddhist College are included.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

4.5 Monitoring and Evaluation 

The monitoring and evaluation of the Eleventh Plan will be based on the National 
Monitoring and Evaluation System (NMES). The NMES comprises the monitoring 
and evaluation institutional set-up and procedures and the Planning & Monitoring 
system (PlaMS) - a web-based computerized system. The monitoring and evaluation 
institutional set-up and procedures are described in the Monitoring and Evaluation 
(M&E) Manual 2006. The manual will serve as a guide for ministries, agencies, 
Dzongkhags and Gewogs in undertaking systematic monitoring and evaluation 
of their plans and programs. The M&E Manual 2006 will be revised during the 
Eleventh Plan to incorporate changes that have taken place, particularly with the 
introduction of Integrated Planning and Monitoring System. 

While the monitoring of plans has been actively pursued and adequate systems 
and capacities developed over the years, very little progress has been made in 
institutionalizing the evaluation aspect. Currently, evaluations are mostly limited to 
donor funded programmes and projects as part of project agreement requirements. 
Therefore, recognizing the importance of evaluation for evidence based planning 
and programming and the need to institutionalize an internal demand for it, the 
evaluation protocol and guidelines have been drafted by GNHC Secretariat in 2012. 
The guidelines will be upgraded to an evaluation policy in the Eleventh Plan. 

4.5.1 Integrated Planning and Monitoring System

The Eleventh Five Year Plan will be monitored using the integrated planning, 
budgeting and expenditure management system. The Planning and Monitoring 
System (PlaMS) of GNHC, Multi Year Rolling Budget System (MYRB) of Department 
of National Budget, and the Public Expenditure Management System (PEMS) of 
Department of Public Accounts, Ministry of Finance have been integrated to share 
planning, budgeting and expenditure information for planning and monitoring 
purposes.

PlaMS, a web based system, is used by all the Planning Officers, Program and 
Project Managers of Ministries, autonomous agencies, Dzongkhags and Gewogs 
for managing the results based five year plan programs, preparing annual work 
plans based on the approved five year plans, and to track plan performance on a 
weekly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual basis. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

MYRB is used by Budget Officers in all RGOB budgetary agencies to manage annual 
and rolling budgets while the PEMS is used by all the Accounts Officers in various 
Government agencies to manage public expenditure on a real time basis. Both the 
systems are web based solutions.

The use of the integrated system by all government agencies commenced from 
July 2013, which coincided with the start of the first fiscal year of the Eleventh 
Plan. The integrated system is aimed at making planning, budgeting and progress 
monitoring more effective and less cumbersome. 

As depicted in the figure below, the integrated planning, budgeting and expenditure 
management system provides a powerful and comprehensive platform for results 
based planning and monitoring. Information on approved Five Year Plans and approved 
annual budget and expenditures is shared automatically in this integrated system.

4.5.2 Mid-Term Review

The Eleventh Plan will be reviewed half way through its implementation to assess 
progress of the Plan and to make mid-term adjustments in policies, programmes 
and projects and allocation of resources. 

4.5.3 Round Table Meeting

The Round Table Meeting (RTM) is an important forum for interaction with our 
development partners on socio-economic development priorities and progress. 
During the Plan period, two RTMs will be held, one towards the beginning of the 
Eleventh Plan and another towards the middle of the Plan. The first RTM for the 
Eleventh Plan will be held in December 2013 to sensitize our development partners 
on the Eleventh Plan priorities and policies. 

Besides the RTM, bilateral consultations, programme and project specific 
reviews, and monitoring and evaluation meetings will be held between the Royal 
Government and development partners as per mutually agreed timings.

5.1 Education Sector

The single most important factor towards achieving the socio-economic 
development goals will be the success of the education sector in enhancing 
the social, economic, cultural, environmental, and political capabilities of our 
most important asset, our people. Education virtually impacts all dimensions of 
development and is critical for ensuring sustainable poverty alleviation which can 
only come through the empowerment of our people, particularly the remote and 
most vulnerable sections of our population. An educated citizenry that is able to 
understand, translate and act upon information, laws, rights and responsibilities is 
critical for ensuring a “vibrant democracy” and effective governance. Similarly, the 
realization of our vision of a “knowledge based society” is absolutely dependent 
on a technically skilled workforce with competencies benchmarked to leading 
industry standards and capabilities to think globally but act locally. Recognizing 
this, the education sector continues to remain a strategic priority for the Royal 
Government and will be given further impetus in the Eleventh Plan.

Education in Bhutan comprises early childcare development, primary and 
secondary education, special education for the physically and mentally challenged, 
non-formal and adult education, monastic education, vocational and technical 
education and training (TVET) and higher or tertiary education. The responsibility 
for the administration of education in Bhutan is shared amongst the Ministry of 
Education (MoE), the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources (MoLHR), the Royal 
University of Bhutan (RUB), and the local governments. Provision of monastic 
education is facilitated by the central monastic body and privately managed 
independent monasteries. Although education plans are centrally coordinated, 
their implementation has largely been decentralized to local governments, schools 
and institutions to ensure greater autonomy, accountability and dynamism to 
achieve desired educational outcomes. 

The school-based education structure comprises of 11 years of free basic education 
from classes Pre Primary to X, divided into 7 years of primary education (PP-VI), 
starting at the age of 6, and 4 years of Secondary Education (VII-X). At the end of the 
cycle (Class X) there is a national board examination, Bhutan Certificate for Secondary 
Education (BCSE). Beyond class X, government funded education is based on merit. 

The Bhutan Council for School Examinations and Assessment (BCSEA) conducts the 
national examinations for classes X and XII. The examinations for classes VI and VIII 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

have been decentralized to the schools, although the questions, model answers 
and marking schemes are provided by the BCSEA.

The TVET system comprises of 8 institutes spread across the country with an 
intake capacity of about 1,000 students a year and 138 teachers. Programmes 
offered vary from 6 months to 2 years at the certificate level in courses ranging 
from electrical, mechanical, construction engineering, auto-mechanics, driving, 
computer hardware, carpentry, furniture making. The two institutes of Zorig 
Chusum provide 2-6 year programmes in the 13 traditional arts and crafts. These 
institutes generally cater to students or school leavers after Class X with the 
objective of imparting knowledge skills necessary to make them employable in the 
labour market. 

Tertiary education in Bhutan comprises of three years of undergraduate studies 
provided by the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) through its 10 constituent 
colleges located in various parts of the country and one private college, the Royal 
Thimphu College. The current total intake of RUB is about 9,000 students. Under-
graduate degree and diploma programmes include civil, mechanical, computer and 
electrical engineering, natural resources, language and cultural studies, education, 
traditional medicine, nursing and health science, business and commerce, 
sciences, and liberal arts studies. In addition the Royal Institute of Management 
provides post-graduate diploma and diploma programmes ranging from 1 to 2 
years in management and development, finance and business, ICT, and law. It 
recently introduced post graduate degree courses in public administration and 
management.

The Monastic body reports that there are 7,240 monastic novices in 388 monastic 
schools and 3 nunneries across Bhutan. This enrolment is significantly lower than 
the one reported for 2006, which was 9287.

5.1.1 Current Situation

The Ministry of Education’s Annual Education Statistics 2013 reports a net primary 
enrollment ratio (PP to VI) of 96 percent, net basic education enrollment ratio 
(PP-X) of 94 percent and adult literacy of 55 percent. Evidently, with high priority 
accorded to the education sector, Bhutan is well on track to achieve the MDGs. In 
terms of the MDGs, the targets for gross primary enrolment ratios, proportion of 
pupils starting grade 1 who reach grade 5, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary 
schools and secondary schools have already been achieved while the other targets 
are well on track to be achieved. 

According to BLSS 2012, the general literacy rate has increased from 59.5 percent 
in 2005 to 63 percent in 2012. Literacy is higher in urban areas at 79 percent as 
compared to 56 percent in rural areas. In terms of gender, literacy is higher among 
males at 72 percent as compared to 55 percent for females. However, the Gender 
Parity Index is calculated at 1.02, indicating that on the whole there is no significant 
gender inequality in the Bhutanese education system. Both boys and girls have 
equal opportunities in terms of access, quality of learning process, equality of 
outcomes and external results.

Last mile challenges and disparities at local levels - The Adjusted Net Enrolment 
Ratio (ANER)29 for primary education is 98.5 percent (2013). This indicates that 1.5 
percent of primary school going age children are out of school. This 1.5 percent

communities, children with learning disabilities whose special learning needs are 
yet to be catered for and children of the urban poor. 

Further, while national statistics indicate good progress in overall enrollment 
rates, the Bhutan Multiple Indicator Survey 2010 indicates that some disparities 
in achievements exist between urban and rural areas, Dzongkhags and genders. 
According to the Survey, the adjusted Net Primary Attendance Ratio (NAR) for 
2010 indicates that Punakha, Chukha, Mongar, Lhuentse, Wangdue and Gasa are 
the six Dzongkhags that have the lowest adjusted NAR, significantly below the 
national average of 91.9 percent. Similarly, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) reveals 
that Pemagatshel, Trongsa, Haa, Punakha and Mongar have a variance in their GPI 
scores by more than 0.03 from 1.0, indicating that some inequity exist in terms 
of gender participation. In all of these five Dzongkhags, the participation level of 
girls in primary education significantly exceeds that of boys. However, these ratios 
change in favor of male children as students move to higher classes mainly due to 
higher drop-out rates among female students.

Addressing the last mile challenge of enrollment, including disparities at local 
levels and catering to the special needs of children with disabilities will require 
innovative and cost effective strategies in the delivery of education.

Relevance and Quality of Education: In spite of the significant progress made with 
regard to providing access to education, the quality of education is an issue of 
growing concern to parents and policy makers. Judging solely by improvements 
in efficiency indicators such as drop-out rates, repetition rates, completion rates 
and survival rates, the quality of education has certainly improved over the years, 
although some of these rates, such as repetition and dropout rates in class IV and 
VII, are still undesirably high and need further improvement. 

However, what remains of great concern is that an increasing numbers of our 
students, including graduates from vocational and tertiary institutions, are 
inadequately prepared to enter the workforce. On the other hand Bhutan continues 
to face an acute shortage of skilled and highly specialized manpower such as 
doctors, engineers, ICT experts and teachers. This has resulted in a paradoxical 
situation of relatively high levels of youth unemployment and a critical skills 
shortage at the same time. Furthermore, the rapid socio-economic development 
and transformative changes that have been taking place, both domestically and 
globally, require higher standards in education at a scale that has never been met 
or required before. The fact that most of our students are unable to meet the 
admission criteria of top tier tertiary education institutions abroad, particularly 
for professional courses, is but one testament of the poor learning outcomes 
of our education not being commensurate to the requirements of youth today. 
This calls for building on our strong foundations an education system that is not 
only free but is of such quality that it provides the knowledge, skills and attitude 
to allow our people to tap their full potential and succeed. Given that today the 
largest section of our population are youth our window of opportunity is small and 
therefore improving the quality of education is urgent. Of particular concern in 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

the outcome of education, which is highly relevant to achieving our Plan objective, 
is weak student performance in the foundational subjects. In all the countries 
that have succeeded in the economic areas we strive to develop, the competitive 
advantage of their education system has been a high level of performance in math 
and science. In our case, most students perform poorly in math and science, and 
have similar weaknesses even in English despite it being the medium of instruction 
for most subjects at all levels in school and higher education. 

According to Royal Education Council’s (REC) research study on the quality of education, 
the overall trend indicates that there is a big gap between the current and the desired 
state in the quality of outcomes and processes. Some of the key deficiencies in the 
quality of learning outcomes and processes highlighted in the report include:

• The overall level of performance of students is just above passing grades;
• Graduates lack basic analytical and communication skills and the attitudes 
needed as entry level professions;
• Teaching consists of one way teacher-led chalk-and-talk without being able 
to get the students to comprehend and demonstrate learning;
• Assessment in the classroom does not close the loop between what is 
taught and what students learn;
• Low academic and professional standards for entry into teaching profession;
• Schools lack quality processes for developing teachers’ capacity, the 
autonomy and instructional resources to initiate academic improvement 
and the essential physical infrastructure to support learning;
• No clear link between the stated national socio-economic goals and the 
goals of the education system; 
• The supporting systems for schools need a great degree of strengthening in 
the areas of teacher preparation, curriculum standards and resources and 
the incentives for quality.


The report underscored three critical reasons for the persistence of ineffective 
classroom practices across schools: namely under-prepared teachers, lack of 
appropriate curricular resources, and poor instructional leadership and in-
service training. The study recommended a thoughtfully designed and carefully 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

implemented comprehensive reform effort to bridge the gap between the 
current set of challenges facing our school system and the high aspirations it 
holds. Various other studies/reports also suggest that education infrastructure 
facilities alone are not sufficient to improve education outcomes but adequate, 
motivated and appropriately qualified teachers play a critical role in ensuring 
quality education. However, our education system continues to be constrained by 
an acute shortage of teachers and limited capacities. Teaching, today, is the least 
preferred profession among graduates, and attracting high performing graduates 
to join teaching is increasingly a major challenge. Some of the reasons for this 
include lack of incentives, both financial and non-financial incentives, perceived 
poor career progression and limitations in the recruitment process. During the 
Tenth Plan, initiatives to strengthen human resource policy to provide better career 
progression for teachers were implemented. However, the proposed teacher 
incentives remains unimplemented due to resource constraints. 

The TVET and tertiary education systems are also faced with a similar set of 
challenges on the issue of relevance and quality of education. Furthermore, current 
projections indicate that about 60,000 students would be completing classes 10 
and 12 and entering the labour market over the Eleventh Plan. If we are to close 
the “education to employment” gap, it is vital to ensure that the TVET and tertiary 
education institutes have the intake capacity to provide relevant and quality post-
secondary education and training to ensure their employability. 

According to REC Report 2008, an independent assessment of the TVET system 
indicates that the content standards of programmes are not reflective of industry 
standards or requirements; students are inadequately trained upon graduation; 
the training institutes are under-resourced and faculty under-qualified; and there 
is a significant “education to employment gap” as students do not necessarily 
follow into the trade for which they have been trained however inadequately. 

There is a widely shared view on the need for the TVET institutes and colleges of 
RUB to be consolidated along a single-campus and multi-disciplinary model if we 
are to ensure relevance and quality in our TVET and tertiary education system. 

Sustainability: The share of education sector budget to the five year plan outlays 
has averaged around 11 percent over the last ten five year plans, with allocation 
increasing from Nu. 9.4 million during the 1st Plan (1961-1966) to Nu. 10.3 billion in 
the 10th Plan (2008-13), of which Nu. 875 million was for current expenditure and 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Nu. 9,489 million for capital expenditure in the Tenth Plan. The expenditure in the 
education sector is expected to further increase in coming years particularly with 
increasing cost of maintenance of past infrastructure investments and additional 
capital investments to absorb the increasing enrollment pressure at various levels. 
In addition, with the phasing out of WFP’s assistance after 2018, the government will 
need to take over the school feeding programme. The school feeding programme 
has been one of the important factors contributing to the better enrollment rates.

5.1.4 Strategies

Any strategy to strengthen our education system and institutions to the level 
required to bring about the transformation in our socio-economic development 
process must ensure that we take a comprehensive stock of the state of our 
entire education system (spanning school, TVET, higher education, and continuing 
education) as an integrated whole rather than disparate parts (including regular 
assessment and diagnostics of student performance and identify the root causes 
of the mismatch between educational outcomes and our developmental needs); 
establish clear quality criteria in terms of the desired outcomes that are responsive 
to the changing expectations of students and are regularly benchmarked to global 
standards (such as student outcomes and employment, instructional methods, 
and organizational dynamism); understand the capacity gaps in achieving those 
criteria; provide a collaborative and highly competent institutional support system 
that focuses on helping students, teachers and school leaders develop research 
based innovative strategies of implementation to achieve the desired outcomes 
and; disseminate those evidence-based effective strategies throughout the system. 
This calls for a sustained systemic strategy rather than disparate interventions 
to address challenges in isolation. The planning and implementation of such an 
education strategy certainly requires a longer-term perspective of more than five 
years. The experience of top performing education systems like in Finland and 
Singapore suggest a gestation of at least 20 years. Most importantly, the strategy 
must be supported with adequate and predictable resources and the necessary 
institutional and policy support systems.

Some of the elements of the strategy for improved outcomes of the education 
sector, relevant to the school, TVET and tertiary education systems, include:

• Clarifying goals and raising performance standards for schools through shared 
national education goals that are aligned with the national socio-economic 
goals; learning standards and quality teaching processes;
• Curriculum improvements to deliver educational goals with greater involvement 
of principals and teachers in curriculum design and communication and training 
on improved curriculum; 
• Attracting the best talent into teaching by recruiting the most capable 
candidates into teaching and preparing them for effective classroom practice;
• Giving teachers the skills and tools to raise the quality of classroom instruction 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

through continuous professional development and structured teaching-
learning resources;
• Developing Principals to become Instructional Leaders – through leadership 
training, professional support and instructional improvement processes;
• Enabling the capacity of schools to focus on learning and teaching through 
policies to promote autonomy, accountability, incentives and improving the 
quality of instructional tools and infrastructure facilities to support learning;
• Maintain relentless focus on implementation – demonstrate real changes in 
school, manage change and build institutional capacity to execute reforms;
• Ensuring students grasp basic academic concepts, acquire essentials life skills 
and are fully equipped for college and professional life;
• The possible introduction of a vouchers scheme for meeting the targets for 
tertiary enrolment that will also encourage private participation in this sector.


Targeted intervention programmes: Targeted intervention programmes will be 
developed to address disparities. The focus will be on Dzongkhags with education 
indicators below the national average and hard to reach communities, children 
in remote areas, nomadic communities etc. Targeted programmes will include 
activities like additional infrastructure facilities, improved teacher deployment, 
special incentive packages and in certain situation where cost of service delivery is 
very high it could include relocation of students to nearby schools with boarding 
facilities. 

Rationalization of schools: In pursuit of improving access, past Plans focused on 
extensive education infrastructure expansion program resulting in 553 schools and 
112 Extended Classrooms (ECRs) for about 180,000 school children. While facilitating 
access and enhancing enrolment, this strategy has led to other challenges. The 
deployment of teachers continues to be a major issue due to the remote and 
difficult location of these extremely small schools. Due to lack of economies of 
scale the difficulty of providing appropriate and adequate infrastructure facilities 
and resources results in multi-grade teaching learning situations which ultimately 
compromise the overall quality of education.

The Eleventh Plan will focus on rationalization of schools with the objective of ensuring 
quality learning outcomes, with particular focus on children in remote rural schools. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The Plan will also ensure sustainability of education service delivery by making efficient 
and effective use of available resources through the rationalization process keeping in 
mind the ground realities facing each Dzongkhag, Gewog and school. 

The approach would be to downgrade unsustainable primary schools with 
enrolment of less than 100 students which do not have scope for future increase in 
enrolment to extended classrooms (ECRs). Currently, there are approximately 270 
primary schools with enrolment of less than 100 children. With rationalization, all 
the primary schools would be developed to ensure that they are adequately and 
appropriately staffed and resourced, and the children have access to an appropriate 
and conducive teaching learning environment. Similarly, the downgraded schools 
or ECRs would be developed to ensure quality learning for the remaining students, 
and the additional teachers made available as a result of the rationalization would 
be redeployed by the Dzongkhag to the schools which face teacher shortage.

Professional Development for Teachers: Towards enhancing teacher morale and 
motivation and improving the quality of the teaching profession, Teacher Human 
Resource Policies and the In-Service Teacher Education and Training (INSET) Masterplan 
have been drawn up for implementation. The Ministry of Education in collaboration 
with Royal Education Council will focus on promoting innovation, creativity and 
enterprise in education through implementation of research recommendations. 

Improved service delivery and private participation: To ensure sustainability, 
school administration and governance system will be strengthened and private 
participation actively pursued. Tracking school rankings, teacher outcomes and 
improving public service delivery will enhanced through Performance Management 
Systems (PMS). Private participation and schemes to encourage self-financed 
students particularly in tertiary education will be developed.

5.1.5 Key Programmes 

Some of the key programmes for the Eleventh Plan:

Education

i) Construction of new schools based on need to increase space especially at the 
secondary levels; 
ii) Provision of minimum standard facilities, wherever required, to ensure a 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

positive environment for teaching-learning process. These include facilities 
such as science labs, libraries, games and sports facilities, computers, ICT 
infrastructure, etc ;
iii) Consolidation of schools through provision of additional facilities such as 
hostels, kitchen and store, warden/matron quarters, toilet facilities, water 
supply, dining hall, etc. in nearby schools and rationalizing smaller schools;
iv) Provision of staff quarters/allowances especially in remote and rural areas to make 
rural posting attractive and improve quality of education in the remote locations;
v) Addressing gender gaps at higher secondary level through provision of gender 
responsive facilities such as hostels and hostel toilets for girls’ toilets and 
housing for female teachers; 
vi) Strengthening curriculum research and development and finding mechanisms 
to enhance efficiency, accountability and retain specialized skills;
vii) Enhance capacity of tertiary education to achieve GER at tertiary education of 
35 percent by 2017-18; 
viii) Enhance quality and relevance of tertiary education programmes to meet the 
needs of individuals as well as the industry and society at large.


TVET

i) Improve quality of TVET/VTI – infrastructure expansion, program diversification 
and curriculum improvement in close collaboration with the industries and 
private sector; and improving capacity of the instructors. 


Programme details are presented in Eleventh Plan Volume II document.

 5.2 Health Sector

All Bhutanese avail free health services from primary to tertiary level health care 
as a right guaranteed by the Constitution of Bhutan under its Principles of State 
Policy, Article 9, Section 21, which states that: “the State shall provide free access 
to basic public health services in both modern and traditional medicines.” Health 
is also an important component for happiness and wellbeing. The 2010 GNH 
Survey reports that health domain contributed 14 percent to GNH, the highest 
contribution among the nine domains. 

While provision of health care services is the responsibility of the Health Sector, 
the need to involve other sectors in addressing health issues is equally important. 
Adoption of the “GNH Policy Screening Tool”31 which has health as one of the 
variables for policy screening has facilitated in mainstreaming health. 

In the Eleventh Plan, the Ministry of Health shall strive towards achieving universal 
health coverage by focusing on providing improved and equitable access to quality 
health care services. Continued efforts shall be made in achieving goals and targets 
beyond MDGs. Investments will also be made in working towards fulfilling the global 
monitoring framework for prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 

5.2.1 Current Situation

Considerable progress has been made in developing the capacity of the health 
system and it has resulted in significant improvements in health outcomes.

Bhutan is on track to achieve MDG targets 
related to child mortality, improving maternal 
health and halting/reversing spread of TB 
and malaria. The lack of progress on HIV/AIDS 
remains a concern. The number of HIV/AIDS 
detected cases has increased from 38 in 2000 
to 321 in 2013. 

Health coverage is estimated at 90 percent. 
Currently there are three health facilities for 
every 10,000 persons. There are 31 hospitals, 
14 BHU I, 178 BHU II and 550 outreach clinics 
providing modern health services. There is one 
Indigenous Hospital and 48 Indigenous Unit providing Sowa Rigpa services. The 
total manpower in the health sector is 4,280, of which 194 are doctors, 736 nurses, 
1,543 other category of health workers and 1,807 administrative and support staff. 

The enactment of the University of Medical Sciences of Bhutan (UMSB) Act and its 
establishment in 2012, is a major initiative of the Health Sector towards providing 
in-country professional medical education and, thereby, addressing the critical 
shortage of health and allied professionals. 

The government health sector expenditure over the last ten years has averaged 
Nu. 1.2 billion per annum with annual expenditure growth of 12.5 percent. The 
government health expenditure as a percentage of GDP stands at 3.23 percent32. 
The recurrent expenditure to GDP in the Eleventh Plan is projected to be around 
0.56 percent. The expenditure in the health sector is expected to increase in the 
coming years with the introduction of new technologies and services and growing 
incidence of non-communicable diseases for which the associated costs are much 
greater than for conventional diseases. The Ministry of Health has started tracking 
national spending and resource flow in health through the National Health Accounts 
and other thematic studies to ensure sustainability of healthcare financing.

5.2.2 Key Challenges

Delivering Quality Health Care – The public expectation for quality health care is 
viewed against the five-star private hospitals. In addition, the easy availability of 
un-validated information from the net with the ever increasing literate population 


32National Health Accounts 2009-10



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

is forcing the public health system to adapt to the latest medical technologies and 
medical procedures. Such adaptations may not necessarily be cost effective and 
efficient in service delivery. 

On the other hand there are no standard health services package developed at 
all levels of service delivery and standard operating procedures for most of the 
services and procedures needs to be developed. In absence of such standards, it 
is very difficult or near impossible to measure the quality of health care delivery. 

Health Human Resource: The Bhutanese Health System suffers from acute 
shortage of all categories of health personnel. The training for most categories of 
health workers and especially for doctors is long and expensive. In addition Bhutan 
does not have training institutes for most categories of health workers. Even in the 
region, there are few reputed health training institutes so limitation in availability 
of slots is a challenge. 

Therefore we will continue to face health human resource shortage in the Eleventh 
Plan even as we face the need to expand health services. Consolidation of health 
infrastructure would therefore be a strategic area of focus. 

With the increasing rate of urbanization, deployment of health personnel to 
rural areas will become a new challenge. Workload, remuneration, and many 
other workplace factors need to be looked beyond Civil Service norms otherwise 
shortage of health human resource will become a major problem.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs): NCDs are establishing its presence with 
modern sedentary lifestyles, traditionally high-fat-based dietary habits and 
consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Consequently, diabetes, hypertension, 
cancers and traffic injuries are increasingly on the rise. Besides the profound 
implication on the quality of life of individuals, families and society at large, the 
cost of treating patients with NCDs is exorbitant. We would need to intensify our 
efforts on health promotion, multi-sectoral response to NCDs and ensuring health 
is considered as a critical component in all policies.

HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) – HIV/AIDS cases 
have increased from 2 in 1993 to 321 in 2013. The expansion of economic activities 
and increasing affluence and travel, import of foreign labour and casual attitude of 
the people towards sex is a major challenge in the battle against HIV/AIDS. The TB 
case detection and treatment is progressing well. However Multi Drug Resistant 
(MDR) TB, and HIV-TB co-infection is increasing. The impact of climate change is 
already becoming visible with malaria cases being detected in areas that were once 
free of the disease. Although Bhutan is making all efforts to eliminate malaria, 
cross border transmission is still an issue. Dengue, chikugunya outbreaks have been 
reported, isolated cases of Kala-azahar are reported and Japanese Encephalitis is 
also suspected to have made its entry. 

Maternal and Child Health- Tremendous progress has been made in the field of 
mother and child health. However, performance on certain indicators such as MMR, 
compared to other countries in the region and the low allocations relative to health 
spending is still a cause of concern. Nearly two-fifth of deliveries are still attended by 
medically untrained personnel increasing the risk of maternal and neonatal death. 
Infant death and especially neonatal death are among the highest death occurring 
within the health facilities. There is a need to invest heavily in this area. 

Nutrition – The general nutritional status of the people has been improving over 
the decade. While malnutrition indicators like underweight prevalence and wasting 
have improved, stunting prevalence of 33.5 percent still remains as a major public 
health issue. In addition, anemia prevalence in women and children are quite 
alarming with 54.8 percent and 80.6 percent respectively. Bhutan has also been

experiencing sporadic outbreaks of vitamin deficiencies, particularly Vitamin B1 
and B12 since 1998, and occurrences have been recorded almost every year. There 
is a need to put in coordinated efforts among Health, Agriculture and Education 
and Economic Sectors to improve the nutritional status. 

Sustainable Healthcare Financing: The constitution mandates the state to provide 
free health care ensuring the global commitment to universal health coverage is 
achieved. Currently the government budget outlay for health is around 6 percent 
and total health expenditure as percent of GDP is 3.6 percent. Global health 
experts recommend for a country like Bhutan allocation of around 5 percent of the 
GDP and about 8 percent of the total government budget on health to ensure that 
quality health care services are provided. 

The Bhutan Health Trust Fund is one innovative mechanism set up by the 
government with support of its partners to ensure sustainable supply of essential 
drugs. The endowment fund of the BHTF stands at around USD 24 million.

There is also a need to promote good governance so that wastage is minimized and 
cost efficient and effective health services are promoted.

5.2.4 Strategies

Strengthening service delivery: In line with the policy of decentralization, the 
local government shall take more responsibility for management and delivery of 
health services at the local level. The centre shall focus more on policy directions, 
service standard development, quality assurance, selection of appropriate medical 
technologies and procedures, ensuring un-interrupted medical supplies and health 
personnel recruitment. The Ministry will continue to focus on improving access 
and delivery of quality health care services by strengthening both institutional 
and human capacity with emphasis on decentralization. The Health Sector will 
continue to explore areas which can be decentralized to the districts. Capacities to 
improve efficiency in management, coordination and planning including resource 
mobilization shall be pursued to strengthen the initiative of decentralized approach. 

In line with the commitment to work towards achieving Universal Health Coverage 
(UHC), the package of Health services to be delivered at every level of health facilities 
shall be standardized and expansion of services will be explored on need basis. 

Health Prevention and Promotion – There has been global evidences to indicate 
that investment in health prevention and promotion aspects are more cost 
effective, than treating diseases, particularly the NCDs, which requires lifelong and 
expensive treatment. Emphasis will be continued to strengthen preventive and 
health promotion, through intensifying awareness programmes, enhancing cross-
sectoral coordination, and advocating for health in all policies to address public 
health challenges such as, but not limiting to NCDs, injuries, HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, 
Maternal and Child Health, Nutrition and Neglected tropical Diseases. 

Health human resources development – Development of health human resource 
in line with the Health HRD Master Plan shall be accelerated. Effective planning 
and efficient deployment of health personnel to improve service delivery will be 
pursued. The deployment of health personnel to hospitals, BHUs and ORCs will be 
need-based depending on number of patients attended by these health centres. 

Sustainable Health Financing – There is a global push to go for achieving Universal 
Health Coverage (UHC). For a developing country like Bhutan, in order to achieve 
UHC, almost 5 percent of the GDP and 8 percent of the total government budget 
needs to be allocated to health sector. In addition, measures such as enhancing 
effectiveness and improving efficiency, and other alternative options to maintain 
constitutional commitment to provide free health care services and also to achieve 
UHC will be explored. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Standardization of eHealth and interoperability –Recognizing that lack of data 
within and between systems hinders care and leads to fragmentation of the 
health information system, it is vital to develop measures for effective and timely 
transmission of data. The development of an integrated health information system 
shall be centralized to ensure the eHealth standardization and interoperability of 
the system. Interoperability is essential in garnering full potential of ICT and medical 
devices towards supporting health system development. Needs assessment 
for eHealth, inclusive of developing national policies, strategies, norms and 
appropriate governance mechanisms, and long term strategic plans or frameworks 
for eHealth, shall be conducted. Usage of ICT enabled healthcare solutions such as 
telemedicine shall be enhanced. 

ICT technology shall also be leveraged to replace some of the paper based system 
to provide better and faster services and save cost. 

Consolidation of health infrastructure – The production of health human resource 
has not kept pace with the expansion of health infrastructure and, therefore, there 
is a huge mismatch between the health human resources and the number of health 
infrastructure, affecting the quality of health services. Also, some of the existing 
facilities are underutilized while others over burdened. Hence, rationalization of 
health infrastructure through use of health facility screening tool and consolidation 
of health infrastructure will be pursued. 

5.2.5 Key Programmes

• Medical Services – Some of the major activities include:
i. Construction of 150 bedded Gelephu Hospital;
ii. Construction of 40 bedded Samtse Hospital;
iii. Construction of 40 bedded Thimphu Hospital;

 5.3 Human Resource Development & Management

Development and management of human resources is an essential prerequisite 
for Bhutan’s aspiration to be an ICT enabled knowledge based society. The high 
priority given to human resource development through investments in education, 
implementation of long and short-term trainings both in-country and ex-country 
and the various reforms in human resource management, particularly in the civil 
services, has to a great extent improved human resource situation. However, 
the quality of human resources particularly in professional and high skilled areas 
continues to be a constraining factor, both in the public and private sector. As a 
result, dependency on foreign workers continues to be high. 

The Eleventh Plan focus will be on creating a highly skilled and well qualified talent pool.

The main agencies responsible for HRD include the Ministry of Education, the 
Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, Royal University of Bhutan and the 
Royal Civil Service Commission. 

5.3.1 Current Situation

Due to small and nascent private sector, most job seekers prefer jobs in the civil service 
for better job security, career advancement and training & educational opportunities. 

As of December 2012, there were a total of 24,275 civil servants, of which 559 
were expatriates and 64 international volunteers. Professional and management 
position made up 49 percent of the total civil service, followed by supervisory 
and support positions with 40 percent and operational position 9 percent. The 
executive and specialist position comprised less than 1 percent of the civil service. 

In terms of educational qualifications, about 66 percent of civil servants have a diploma 
and below, 22 percent have Bachelors Degree and the rest have a post graduate diploma, 
Masters or Ph.D degree. Lack of qualified human resources in various positions is an 
issue and only about 47 percent of the civil servants meet the minimum qualification 
criteria. A large percentage of civil servants not meeting the required qualification 
criteria were in the supervisory & support and operational position categories.

5.3.2 Key Challenges

While the overall civil service size has been on the rise, the percentage of civil 
servants in various position levels not meeting the minimum qualification criteria 
remains high. This is an issue of great concern particularly if the high numbers are 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

in educational and vocational institutions. 

The current human resource development strategy also lacks synergy between 
the education system and manpower needs leading to mismatch of aspirations 
of the job seekers and jobs available. On one hand, we continue to be dependent 
on expatriates, international volunteers and foreign skilled manpower while on 
the other hand unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, remains high. 
Some of the sectors, particularly health, education, construction, ICT and aviation 
continue to depend on expatriates and volunteers to fill in the gap. 

Further, retention of the civil servants is becoming a challenge. Increasingly, many 
teachers, engineers, doctors and technical professionals are leaving the civil service 
to join international organizations, corporations, and projects offering better 
remuneration and service benefits. For instance, in the education sector, where 
there is already an acute shortage of teachers, the teacher turnover is high at about 
4 percent annually. In the last 9 months alone, education sector lost 261 teachers34. 
Therefore, addressing human resource management issues need urgent attention to 
enhance performance, efficiency and motivation among the civil servants. 

The other key challenge is the implications of growing civil service on recurrent expenditures. 
Currently, pay and allowance comprise about 45 percent of the total recurrent costs. If the 
present annual growth trend of civil service continues it is likely to put a significant burden 
on recurrent costs in the coming years that may not be sustainable.

5.3.3 Sector Key Result Areas 

The key result areas will be based on RCSC’s Human Resource Development Master 
Plan for civil service and Ministry of Labour and Human Resources’ HRD Plan for 
Private Sector. 

5.3.4 Strategies 

In order to improve performance and efficiency of the civil service, civil services 
rules and regulation, processes and systems will be reviewed and updated. 

In terms of human resource development, the focus will be on creating skills and 
knowledge to achieve the objectives of EDP 2010, with an emphasis on addressing 
the acute shortage of skilled professionals such as doctors, educationists, engineers, 
architects and ICT specialists. The support to private sector will mainly be in terms 
of short-term vocational skills and entrepreneurship skills training. 

All definite and firm resources will be earmarked and programmed for critical HR 
requirements. For individuals accessing international scholarships through open 
competitions, unlike past practice of adjusting such trainings against HRD master 
plan slots, can pursue it without requiring necessary adjustments. However, this 
does not apply to HR that has been already programmed with firm resources 
mentioned above.

From the total of Nu. 2 billion allocated for Human Resource Development, Nu. 
1.4 billion will be earmarked for technical and critical skills development and the 
remaining Nu. 0.6 billion for general human resource development programmes.

 5.4 Employment

The Labour and Employment Act 2007 govern the employment and working 
conditions in Bhutan. One of the objectives of the Economic Development Policy 
2010 is to achieve full employment by 2020. Full employment is defined as 
employment of 97.5 percent or unemployment rate of 2.5 percent. 

Employment is defined as “if a person has performed some paid work in cash or 
in kind, during the reference period for at least one hour or the person has a job 
or business formally attached but temporarily absent from the work and going to 
resume the work”. “Reference period refers to the week preceding the date of the 
survey interview”35. Labour Force Surveys are conducted by the Ministry of Labour 
and Human Resources on an annual basis.

Agriculture sector continues to be the largest employer accounting for 62 percent 
of total employment, followed by public administration at 8 percent, manufacturing 
at 5 percent and others contributing less than 5 percent. In terms of gender, the 
percentage of females employed are higher in agriculture, wholesale and retail 
trade, and hotels and restaurants sectors.

At the Dzongkhag level, the unemployment was highest in Thimphu with an 
unemployment rate of 4.3 percent followed by Sarpang, Trongsa, Tsirang, Dagana, 
Paro and Zhemgang all registering unemployment rates higher than the national 
average of 2.1 percent. Gasa, Bumthang, Pema Gatshel and Samdrup Jongkhar had 
unemployment rate of less than 1 percent.

5.4.2 Key Challenges

Quality of employment – While we have been successful in reducing unemployment 
rates, the review of LFS 2012 indicates that the quality of employment could be 
improved.

• The agriculture and forestry sector continue to be the largest employer 
while contributing least to GDP growth rate. The impressive economic 
growth achieved by the secondary and tertiary sectors has not translated 
into jobs, thereby indicating some levels of inequity in economic growth. 
• Even among the employed many are still vulnerable and lack income and 
social security as 40 percent of those employed are agriculture family 
workers. Women are particularly vulnerable as they comprise 27.6 percent 
in this category.
• About 68.9 percent of those employed in the agriculture sector worked for 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

more than 48 hours of which 46.1 percent reportedly work more hours to 
increase earnings indicating low income for those employed in the sector.
• Only 33 percent of those employed earned monthly incomes of Nu. 
10,000 or more.
• In terms of the level of education, 53.6 percent of those employed were 
illiterate with the next highest level being middle secondary school level 
dropouts at 11 percent. Only 4.1 percent had either an undergraduate 
or Bachelors degree. This indicates either a poor synergy between the 
education system and manpower needs resulting in a lack of skilled 
manpower or a mismatch of potential employees and jobs available.


Creation of new jobs: During the next five years, approximately 120,000 jobs 
seekers will be entering the labour market. Out of this, 60 percent will be those with 
education qualifications of Class X and higher. While this presents an opportunity 
of a large number of educated job seekers, creating jobs that meets the aspirations 
of these qualified youth will be a major challenge. The Labour Force Survey 2012 
estimates that the unemployment rate among the middle secondary education 
group was the highest at 22.8 percent. This was followed by the higher secondary 
education group at 20.4 percent and Bachelor Degree group at 12.3 percent.

potential for creating 120,000 jobs for corresponding number of job seekers in the 
Eleventh Plan. The services sector presents the highest potential for absorbing job 
seekers followed by industries and agriculture.

The jobs in service sector - hotels and restaurant; transport, storage and 
communications; wholesale and retail; real estate, renting and business activities 
- are expected to grow as a result of doubling of tourist arrivals from 100,000 
to 200,000 and initiation of seven new mega hydropower projects during the 
Eleventh Plan. The jobs in the industrial sector are also expected to grow with 
the commissioning of three new hydropower projects, establishment of power 
intensive industries and construction activities related to mega hydropower 
projects. The share of agriculture sector for new employment is expected to be 
very low, in absence of any other policy intervention.

Hence, jobs will be available but the greater challenge would be to match supply 
of jobs with the right skills in the labour market.

 5.5 Renewable Natural Resources (RNR) Sector

RNR sector comprises of agriculture, livestock and forestry. For an agrarian country 
like Bhutan, the RNR sector plays a vital role in bringing about equitable development 
through enhancing rural prosperity and poverty alleviation. About 62.238 percent 
of the population directly depended on agriculture for their livelihood. 

However, in spite of the changes and innovations infused over the years to propel 
RNR sector growth, the sector’s growth remained insufficient to adequately 
address rural poverty, attain food security and to sustain the overall economic 
growth. The sector’s full potential is challenged by low productivity due to issues 
such as acute shortage of farm labour driven by outbound rural-urban migration, 
loss of arable land to urbanization, difficult terrain, fragmented land holdings, loss 
of crops to wildlife, lack of access to market and agricultural credit, climate change 
and natural disasters, post harvest management issues and subsistence nature of 
farming. Consequently, dependence on import of food and food grains remain 
high and returns to farmers remain small as a result of higher costs of production 
and low economies of scale.

5.5.1 Current Situation

Based on food availability, access and nutrition, Bhutan is modestly food secure. 60 
percent of cereal, vegetables and animal products are domestically produced, and 
95 percent of fruits and nuts are domestically available, with apples and oranges 
enough to be exported. However 97 percent of fish, 80 percent of beef and 77 
percent of pork demand and 90 percent of oils and fats are still met from imports 
(as of 2010)38. In terms of access, about 3 percent of the population spends less 
per person than the food poverty line of Nu. 1,154.7439. The nutritional status40, 
measured in terms of stunting prevalence, while reduced from 56 percent in 1988 
to 33.5 percent in 2010, still remains high. 

RNR sector is also the largest employer. As per Labour Force Survey 2012, 62.2 
percent of those employed were in RNR with 23.9 percent male and 38.4 percent 
female. The survey also reveals that among all occupation groups, 68.9 percent of 
those employed in agriculture worked for more than 48 hours per week due to the 
sector providing the lowest monthly income in all occupation groups. 

The share of agriculture to real GDP has declined by more than half from 25 percent 
in 2001/02 to 12 percent in 2011/12 mainly because of higher growth in other led 
by the electricity and construction and also due to various challenges faced by the 
sector itself. In terms of nominal GDP in current prices, agriculture contribution 
has doubled from Nu 6 billon in 2001/02 to Nu. 14 billion in 2011/12.

5.5.2 Key Challenges

Loss of agriculture land and declining productivity – Achieving food self-
sufficiency would largely depend on area under food grain cultivation and yield 
per hectare. Both are on the decline. Rapid development and urbanization has put 
a lot of pressure on agriculture land. According to the Department of Agriculture’s 
estimates, about 2000 acres of agricultural land was lost to non-agriculture 
development purposes during 1998-2008. This is likely to increase in the near 
future with increased development activities unless effective measures are put in 
place to protect prime agricultural lands. 

Studies also indicate that yield per hectare has been on the decline at a compounded 
annual rate of 1.84 percent over the last 27 years. This could be attributed to 
various factors such as declining investment in the agriculture sector, loss of 
prime agriculture land to other use, climate change, land being kept fallow due 
to shortage of farm labour/irrigation, loss of crop to wildlife and limited scope of 
mechanization. Unless these issues are addressed in the Eleventh Plan, achieving 
food self-sufficiency goal in the Eleventh Plan will still remain a challenge.

Agriculture Environment and Challenges - Agriculture farming is characterized by 
steep geographic terrain. With the exception of few wide valleys in the western, 
central and some plains in the southern part of the country, in most part agricultural 
lands are located on the slopes. Assessment indicates that 31 percent of the 
agriculture land is located on slopes more than 50 degrees. This is also one of the 
reason why soil erosion rate is high, estimated at 8.6 tonnes/ha or approximately 
3.5 t/acres (DOA, 2011). 

Moreover, despite having an abundance of water resources, agriculture is still 
dominated by the rain-fed dry land farming and wetland cultivation. Of the 77,493 
acres of “chuzhing” only 59,243 acres are serviced with improved irrigation system. 
Dry land irrigation for other crops is virtually non-existent. 

Further, pest and diseases continue to be a problem for the farming communities. 
Feral vertebrate pests such as wild boar and deer, apes such as monkey and 
marsupial like porcupine are major problem. It is estimated that 126 kgs of crops 
per household are lost annually to wild animals pests. Other crop diseases such as 
Gray Leaf Spot and Turcicum Leaf Blight in maize, Greening in Citrus, phythoptra 
diseases in chilli and potatoes also continue to pose major challenges.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Domestic cattle and equine population left stray in winter is one of leading factor 
discouraging farmers from growing winter and spring crops such as wheat, barley 
and buckwheat affecting the cropping intensity and overall production potential. 

Labor shortage including increasing feminization of the agricultural labour force 
is becoming one of the leading constraints in agriculture production. According to 
agriculture statistics 2011, available farm labour constitutes only 26 percent. Rural 
female population is more by 3.7 percent overall. In the age group of 15-64 which 
is also an active population group, female population is higher by 7.5 percent, and 
this is likely to increase. This gender imbalance in agriculture workforce will also 
have significant impact on agriculture.

These factors have contributed to RNR sector providing the least monthly earnings 
among all major occupations. If this trend continues, it is likely that more and more 
people could leave their farms which could adversely impact the goals of achieving 
food and nutrition security, reducing unemployment levels and, may likely reverse 
the gains achieved in poverty reduction.

5.5.4 Strategies

A key strategy will be to transform the RNR sector into a commercially viable sector 
that provides higher returns to the farmers, improves rural livelihood, reduces 
imports and promotes exports, and offers attractive employment opportunities 
to youth. To facilitate this transformation, focused initiatives will be undertaken as 
follows:

Targeted and commodity focused approach: One Gewog One Product, based on 
commercial viability of such product and the potential of different Gewogs, will 
be one of the strategies to achieve the objective of food and nutrition security. At 
national level, the focus will be on fewer prioritized products that will enhance food 
self sufficiency and also contribute to import substitution and export promotion. 
The Dzongkhags identified to produce prioritized products will be provided 
necessary support, both technical and resources, by the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forests through central RNR programmes. 

Transition from subsistence to commercial agriculture: Investment in the RNR 
sector will be aimed at ensuring gradual transition from subsistence to commercial 
production. This would require introduction and application of technologies that 
improves productivity of crop, forest and livestock. To provide both economies of 
scale and fair terms of trade, the evolving farmers’ organizations and cooperatives 
will be supported technically and financially, notably through preferential access 
to loans from financial institutions, extension support services and other forms of 
support. 

Enabling environment: A policy and legal framework that incentivizes RNR 
production and promotes private sector investment will be implemented. Access 
to finance will be facilitated through priority lending by financial institution to the 
RNR sector. Infrastructure facilities such as irrigation, storage and communication 
to facilitate efficient and effective production, marketing and distribution of RNR 
products will be prioritized. Linkages between research and extension services will 
be strengthened and streamlined to improve the productivity of farming systems.

Promote private sector participation and contract farming: Government will 
facilitate an enabling environment for private sector participation and contract 
farming to enhance market access, innovations and technical expertise. Private 
sector participation will be encouraged in the entire value-chain, starting from 
agriculture input supply to production, processing, distribution and marketing. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

A reliable institutional mechanism will be established to effectively cater to the 
needs of the interested private entities. Wherever applicable, best practices gained 
from the Hazel nut and Coffee plantation ventures will be used to attract private 
investment in the RNR sector. 

5.5.5 Key programmes 

Some of the major programmes are as follows:

• National field crops development 
• Agriculture infrastructure development 
• National Organic 
• National horticulture development 
• National livestock development 
• Market development 
• RNR Research and extension services 
• National bio-security and food safety

 5.6 Tourism Sector

Tourism in Bhutan is governed by the policy of “high value-low impact” tourism. 
The policy serves to develop tourism that has minimum negative impact on our 
natural and cultural heritage. The tourism pricing of USD $200 per person per 
night during off-seasons and USD $250 per person per night during seasons forms 
the basis for regulating tourist arrivals. Travel to Bhutan is booked either through 
Bhutanese tour operator or their international partners. 

Culture and nature are the two leading purposes for tourist arrivals. The majority 
of arrivals are in spring (February-April) and autumn (August-October) season. 

The tourism sector is the major source of foreign exchange earnings and 
employment. Gross earnings in 2012 were USD 62.80 million and approximately 
22,045 employment opportunities were created in 2011. Out of USD 62.80 million, 
USD 16.63 million was generated as direct revenue for the Government through 
the “Royalty” (35 percent tourism levy on daily tariff). Other taxes such as the 
Business Income Tax (BIT) and Sales Taxes paid by tourism service providers also 
translate into government revenue, therefore increasing revenue generated by the 
tourism industry. 

5.6.1 Current Situation

With improvements in tourism infrastructure facilities and better air connectivity, 
the number of tourist arrivals to Bhutan has increased from about 6,000 in 2001 
to about 105,407 in 2012. The figure includes 54,685 international visitors and 
50,722 regional visitors. The average length of stay was 6.90 days.

The arrival figures include about 57 percent international visitors, 26 percent regional 
high-end visitors, 16 percent MICE (Meeting, Incentive, Conferences, Exhibition) 
visitors, and 1 percent familiarization visitors. The highest number of visitors was 
from Japan at 15.98 percent, followed by USA at 13.67 percent and China at 8.57 
percent. Among the regional tourist, arrivals from India topped the list with 87 
percent, followed by Bangladesh at 11 percent and Maldives at 2 percent.

In terms of the tourism spread, Paro Dzongkhag hosted the maximum bed 
nights (32.69 percent) followed by Thimphu, Wangduephodrang, Punakha and 
Bumthang. Pemagatshel, Zhemgang, Tsirang, Dagana, Sarpang and Samtse were 
among the Dzongkhags that hosted less than 0.04 percent bed nights. This is due 
to lack of tourism products in these Dzongkhags. However this is likely to change in 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

the coming years with the Royal Manas National Park being open to tourism. The 
tourist arrivals in Trashigang and Samdrup Jongkhar have improved significantly as 
a result of opening of Merak Sakteng trek and also use of Samdrup Jongkhar as an 
entry point from the south-east. 

The tourism package covers the cost of accommodation in a ‘3-Star’ and above 
category hotel, local guide and transportation, and three meals. Currently, there 
are 123 accommodation providers with a capacity of 2,749 rooms offering 5,464 
bed nights consisting of 8 ‘5-Star’, 7 ‘4-Star’, 40 ‘3-Star’, 54 ‘2-Star’ and 19 ‘1-Star’ 
category. Accommodation classified as ‘2-Star’ and below have been encouraged 
to upgrade to ‘3-Star’ and above in order to cater to tourist. The annual occupancy 
rates was highest in the ‘3-Star’ category with 34.46 percent followed by ‘5-Star’. 

In terms of tour operators, there were 741 registered local tour operators, of which 
318 were operational. The top 12 tour operators accounted for 41.46 percent of 
total arrivals with the highest number of tourists managed by a single operator of 
4,159 visitors. 

5.6.2 Key Challenges

It is evident from the above that the tourism sector has made much progress and 
is one of the key economic sectors contributing to economic growth, employment 
and revenues. However, constraints in terms of accessibility, regional spread, 
seasonality and product diversification are still issues of concern. 

With just one international airport at Paro and with only Druk Air, the national carrier 
with a fleet of three Airbus A319 and one ATR 42-500, flying to limited destinations 
in the region, traveling to Bhutan is a challenge to many visitors. The number of 
visitors to Bhutan currently is determined by Druk Air’s capacity. In 2012, about 88 
percent of the visitors used air as preferred mode of travel to Bhutan. Since October 
2013, a private airline, Bhutan Airlines owned by of Tashi Air Private Limited, started 
operating between Paro and Bangkok sector with one Airbus 320. 

The other major challenge faced is the shortage of manpower in the form of trained 
guides, skilled workers in hospitality sector, qualified and experienced professionals 
in product development, destination marketing and other tourism-related services. 
The sector is still largely dependent on international tour operators for arrivals. 

Among the 20 Dzongkhags, Paro, Thimphu, Punakha, Wangduephodrang and 
Bumthang are the major beneficiaries of tourism. Lack of tourist infrastructure 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

facilities/amenities, travel time and limited tourism products are some of the 
reasons for other Dzongkhags not benefitting much from the sector. However, 
with the completion of three domestic airports and efforts already underway to 
create infrastructure facilities and products in Central, South and East, the lack of 
regional spread is expected to be addressed in the next few years.

5.6.4 Strategies

Tourism will be one of the priority sectors under Rapid Investments in Selected 
Enterprises (RISE) programme. Under the programme, selected initiatives that 
contribute to achieving higher yields per tourist as well as double the arrivals but 
spread throughout the country and throughout the calendar year will be defined 
and implementation of these initiatives closely monitored. 

5.6.5 Key Programmes.

• Sustainable Tourism Development: The focus of this programme will 
include product diversification to ensure regional and seasonal spread, 
improving quality and standards of services including accommodation

and tourism attractions, exploring new markets, and decentralization of 
tourism planning and development. Further, the programme will ensure 
that local communities are able to reap the benefits from this industry. 
The thrust area for this industry will continue to be high end sustainable 
tourism destination.
• Strengthening of Royal Institute of Tourism and Hospitality: The Institute 
is expected to enhance the quality of tourism and hospitality professionals 
by benchmarking its training programmes to international standards and 
working towards its vision of becoming a regional center of excellence. The 
training modules and curriculum will be reviewed and improved based on 
periodic training needs assessments. Required additional infrastructures will 
be put in place and capacity development of faculties will receive priority.

 5.7 Trade, Industries & Mines Sector

This is a critical sector for sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The 
high priority accorded to the sector over the last five decades has resulted in significant 
structural changes in the economy with secondary and tertiary sectors taking over the 
primary sector and annual growth rates averaging around 8 percent per annum over 
the last decade. However, the structural change has not translated into productive 
employment opportunities, vibrant private sector growth and economic diversification. 
The economy continues to be driven by hydropower and construction sectors with 
limited potential for employment creation. Besides, small domestic market, difficult 
terrain, high transportation costs, lack of skilled human resources and access to finance 
remain major challenges to sustainable economic growth. 

In an effort to diversify the economy and address the challenges, the Economic 
Development Policy (EDP) was adopted in 2010. The EDP targets high value and 
low volume green services and products that have minimal impact on environment 
– potential sectors include tourism, Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) and IT enabled industries, cultural industries, construction and high-value 
niche commercial and organic agricultural products. 

The main thrust area for the trade, industries and mining sectors in the Eleventh 
Plan is “Brand Bhutan, Economic Diversification and Inter-generational Equity”. 

5.7.1 Current Situation

Trade: India is Bhutan’s largest trading partner accounting for 84 percent of exports 
and about 73 percent of imports. In 2011, Bhutan’s imports from India were worth 
Nu. 35.2 billion while exports to India amounted to Nu. 26.3 billion, leading to a trade 
deficit of Nu. 8.8 billion42 (10 percent of GDP). Electricity export makes up 38 percent 
of the total exports to India (Nu. 10.4 billion) while 51 percent of imports from India 
comprises of mineral fuel, base metal and vehicles. The balance of trade with India 
was in surplus till 2009 and thereafter it ran into deficit with imports outpacing 
exports with the commencement of three hydro-power projects in 2010-11. 

Trade with rest of the world accounted for 16 percent of exports and 27 percent 
of imports. After India, the other major trading partners include Bangladesh, 
Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. The main items of export 
were agro products (apples, oranges, mushrooms, cordyceps) and the main items 

42Statistical Yearbook 2012, NSB. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

of imports were vehicles (22 percent of total imports in 2011), machinery and 
mechanical appliances (42 percent of total imports in 2011). 

Table 5.7.1 – Trade Statistic



Source: Statistical Year book 2012, NSB.

The wholesale and retail trade’s share of GDP averaged around 6 percent during 
the last five years and created an employment of 3.8 percent in 2012. The trade 
sector’s contribution to national revenue increased from Nu. 2,789 m (19 percent 
of total revenue) in 2008-09 to Nu. 7,166 m (34 percent of total revenue) in 2011-
1243. The increase is attributed to higher remittances from excise duty refund, sales 
tax collections from goods and alcoholic products, customs duty, and corporate 
and business tax from trading units.

Trade with India is based on a Free Trade and Commerce Agreement between the 
two countries, that was renewed in 2006 for ten years. With Bangladesh, which is one 
of the top three export destinations, Bhutan has a Preferential Trade Agreement that 
was renewed in 2009 for five years. The current trading arrangement allows duty/
tax free access to 18 exportable items from Bhutan to Bangladesh. Trade between 
Bhutan and Bangladesh has seen a substantial increase in the last five years. Imports 
from Bangladesh increased from a meager amount of Nu. 75.41 million in 2007 to Nu. 
169.35 million in 2011. Import from Bangladesh in 2010 was recorded at Nu. 190.11 
million, which is the highest till date. Similarly, exports to Bangladesh increased 
from Nu. 469.59 million in 2007 to Nu. 1226.66 million in 2011. The balance of trade 
has always been in Bhutan’s favour ever since the commencement of trade with 
Bangladesh.

Bhutan and Thailand signed the Trade and Economic Cooperation agreement in 
November 2013. The value of Bhutan’s exports to and imports from Thailand was 
Nu. 4.67 million and Nu. 1,223.70 million respectively in 2011. 

Bhutan is also negotiating trade agreement with Nepal. For the year 2011, the 
value of Bhutan’s export to and import from Nepal were Nu. 76.00 million and Nu. 
138.89 million respectively. 

In terms of global and regional trade agreements, accession to World Trade 
Organization (WTO) is still under consideration. The Working Party for Accession 
to WTO was established in 1999 and its memorandum on Bhutan’s Foreign Trade 
Regime was submitted in 2003. At the regional level, Bhutan is member of the 
Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation 
(BIMSTEC). The negotiation on BIMSTEC free trade agreement is on-going. 

The South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) aimed at reducing tariffs for 
intraregional trade between the eight South Asian countries came into effect on 1 
January 2006. It aims to reduce tariffs in stages to reach 0-5 percent level by 2013, 
with a longer time frame for the Least Developed Countries (Bhutan, Bangladesh 
and Nepal) to reach that goal by 2016. Due to the large number of products in 
the sensitive list, trade expansion under SAFTA has been limited; Bhutan has 150 
products in the list compared to 1,257 products in Nepal’s list. Reductions in the 
number of products under this list by member states are still being negotiated 
by the Working Group on Reduction in the Sensitive Lists. The other agreement 
within the SAARC framework is on Trade in Services (SATIS) which was signed at the 
Sixteenth SAARC Summit held in Thimphu from 28-29 April 2010. The Agreement 
has been ratified by all the Member States and negotiations on finalization of 
schedules of specific commitments are ongoing.

Industries – Industries is dominated by few major manufacturing firms based on 
mineral and metal and a large number of smaller firms dealing in handicrafts, food 
processing, construction, wood and paper processing. In 201144, there were 22,776 
industrial firms, of which 133 were large, 220 medium, 2,649 small and 19,774 
cottage industries. In terms of the type of industries, there are 291 agro-based, 
831 forests based, 209 mineral based, 20,799 services and 646 others. Among 
the Dzongkhags, Thimphu Dzongkhag had the highest number of industrial firms 
representing about 35 percent (7,973) followed by Chukha with 14 percent (3,094). 
Gasa had the least with 76 cottage industries followed by Lhuentshe with 198. 

44Statistical Yearbook 2012, NSB. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The major industries are located at Samtse (cement, fruit processing and liquor), 
Pemagatshel (gypsum mining), Gelephu (wood processing and liquor), Thimphu 
(agro and wood processing) and Phuentsholing (calcium carbide, ferrosilicon, 
plaster of paris, steel, beverages, bottling plant). Many of the major industries are 
located in the South due to proximity to the Indian market both for raw material 
and exports. The industries in the north are mostly small and medium sized 
cottage industries in agro-processing, wood-based, cultural industries (textile and 
handicrafts) and handmade paper. 

To achieve the objective of Economic Development Policy 2010, the Foreign 
Direct Investment Policy (FDI) was revised in 2010 and made more liberal by 
incorporating a negative list in its provisions. Since its revision, 41 FDI projects 
have been approved of which 18 are operating and 24 projects have been issued 
with FDI registration certificates. The FDI projects are in hotels, hydropower, 
pharmaceuticals, dairy, steel, water bottling and banking. The holding of foreign 
investors’ range from 20 percent to 100 percent, with Mountain Hazelnut Ventures 
Private Limited being a 100 percent foreign owned company. The key sources of 
FDI into Bhutan are from India, Hong Kong, USA, Japan, Singapore, Samoa, France, 
and Vietnam. Banking accounts for the largest share of FDI, with the International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) buying a 20 percent stake in the Bhutan National Bank, 
followed by the hydropower sector with foreign investment of Nu. 1.22 billion for 
the 115 MW Dagachhu hydropower project.

Foreign Direct Investment Inflows

The industry sector’s contribution to GDP was the highest averaging around 40 
percent per annum over the last five years with manufacturing sector contributing 
10 percent.

Mining - Bhutan has pursued mining activities cautiously bearing in mind the social 
and environmental consequences. The sector is, therefore, still underdeveloped. 
Although Bhutan has significant deposits of a number of mineral resources, 
including limestone, coal, graphite, gypsum, slate and dolomite, most mining 
activities are limited to relatively small operations and mainly involve the above 
minerals. The total mineral production ranges from 5000 metric tons to over 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

a million metric tons annually. All the mines in the country are operated using 
opencast mining technique and the current land coverage by mining activities is 
0.033 percent of the total area of the country. About 15,000 square kilometer 
from the total geographical area of 38,394 square kilometer has been geologically 
mapped in the scale of scale of 1:50,000 systemically. There are currently about 55 
registered firms in the mining sector.

Mining is important source of revenues. During the period 2005 to 2011, revenues 
from mining sector ranged from Nu. 155 million to Nu. 233 million annually, 
excluding business/corporate/personal income taxes paid by the promoters of 
the mines. The mineral production and their uses over the last three years are as 
follows.

Table 5.7.3 – Mineral Productions



Further development of mining sector will be pursued considering the 
environmental and social impacts and intergenerational equity.

5.7.2 Key Challenges

Foreign trade – Foreign trade is dominated by a few products. In 2011, about 80 
percent of Bhutan’s total export amounting to Nu. 31,485 million comprised of 
electricity (Nu. 10,411 million), mineral products (Nu. 4,626 million - ferro-alloys, 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

calcium carbide, silicon manganese and silicon carbide) and base metal (Nu. 
10,476 million - steel bars, ingots and copper wire). The export earnings from these 
products are highly vulnerable with the production of electricity highly dependent 
on hydrological flows and the uninterrupted operation of the hydro power plants 
and mineral and base metals products being currently competitive only due to 
cheap electricity rather than any technological advantage. Further, due to high 
import content of raw materials for these products, they account for the highest 
share of the import bill. The import bills for base metal and mineral products in 2011 
were Nu. 8,565 million and Nu. 10,805 million respectively. The next major export 
product is agriculture products (mandarin, potatoes, apples, cordyceps and agro 
products) which accounted for about 5 percent of the total exports. Bhutan faces 
major challenge in product diversification. Continued emphasis on mineral products 
and base metals for export promotion could mean compromising on environmental 
concerns and having to continue to provide electricity to these industries at prices 
lower than export prices. Diversification of our exports in agricultural and non-
mineral and non-metal products will however require substantial investments. 

Ease of Doing Business - In the 2012 IFC/World Bank Report on “Ease of 
Doing Business” Bhutan ranked 142 out of 183 countries. The areas requiring 
improvements were resolving insolvency, protecting investors, getting electricity 
and dealing with construction permits amongst others. In the region, Bhutan ranks 
seventh out of eight countries.

Industrial base - About 85 percent of Bhutanese industries are small and micro 
industries dealing in agro products, textiles and handicrafts and large number of 
such industries are located in urban areas. While development of such industries 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

are important in view of Bhutan’s desire to develop clean green manufacturing 
industries with high potential for employment and for promoting broad based 
inclusive growth, they are constrained by lack of access to capital, technology, 
markets and labour resulting in low volume, high cost and inferior quality products. 

Mining - In the absence of a clear mineral development policy, the management, 
allocation and monitoring of mining sector has been difficult. The sector also 
faces human resource constraints both in the government and the private mining 
sector which has hampered effective functioning of the sector. The draft Mineral 
Development Policy has been prepared to address these issues, and is expected to 
be approved within the first year of the Eleventh Plan.

5.7.4 Strategies

The flagship programme to accelerate economic growth and achieve the objective 
of self reliance will be the Rapid Investments in Selected Enterprises (RISE) 
programme. The Government, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

will identify 4-5 non-hydro priority sectors for end-to-end intervention in the 
Eleventh Plan. The selection of priority sectors will be based on three filters of i) 
employment generation, ii) revenues to the government, and iii) returns to the 
entrepreneurs. Tentatively, the sectors identified are tourism (to achieve higher 
yields per tourist as well as double the arrivals but spread throughout the country 
and throughout the calendar year), agro-processing (selected produce with high 
potential), construction (enhance the capacity of Bhutanese contractors to deliver 
quality and take on more complex projects), small and cottage industries (including 
cultural industries such as textiles, arts and crafts) and manufacturing (explore 
establishment of few large scale hydro-power intensive industries). 

A detailed blue print of interventions will be developed with clear initiatives, 
time line, targets, resource requirements and persons responsible to deliver the 
initiatives. The implementation of the programme will be rigorously monitored by 
the Cabinet and Committee of Secretaries and problem solving sessions facilitated 
to expedited smooth implementation of the programme.

To facilitate private sector development, the government will facilitate the 
development of economic infrastructure such as industrial estates in Jigmeling in 
Gelephu, Dhamdum in Samtse, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar and Bondeyma in 
Mongar and establishment of dry ports in Phuentsholing. 

The government will also review and address issues related to excise refund, 
access to finance particularly for cottage, small and medium industries, reduction 
in turn-around-time for Government to Business (G2B) services specially in terms 
of government clearances/ approvals, and development of capital markets. 

5.7.5 Key Programmes 

Some of the key programmes include:

• Export Promotion and Market Access: The programme aims to strategically 
enhance our export capacity and leverage our comparative advantages 
to build our competitiveness in the international market through export 
promotion and marketing and facilitation of exports through integration 
into the regional and international trading environment.
• Strengthening Trade Policy and Regulatory Framework: The emphasis will be 
on strengthening the policy and regulatory framework to improve and simplify 
the procedures for business start-ups, prevent business malpractices, promote 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

fair competition in the market and promote international best practices in 
the business environment. The drafting of the Consumers’ Protection Act and 
enactment of the Trade Development Act and the Competition Policy/Act 
are key policy and regulatory instruments that will be pursued. Further, the 
Dechencholing fuel depot will be relocated to Thinchupangkha under Paro 
Dzongkhag and Fuel quality will be upgraded to Euro IV.
• Promotion of sustainable and environment friendly industrial development 
- The focus will be on development of industrial parks to promote private 
sector development and enhance socio-economic activity in a particular 
region. In order to promote balanced regional development and enhance 
rural economy, four Industrial Parks will be developed and established at 
Bondeyma in Mongar, Dhandhum in Samtse, Motanga in Samdrup Jongkhar 
and Jigmeling in Sarpang. Further, the development and management of 
industrial parks in Jigmeling and Dhamdum would be pursued through PPP 
model and additional infrastructures in existing parks would be developed
• Development of Cottage & Small Industries (CSIs) in Bhutan: The growth 
of CSIs are essential for poverty alleviation, employment generation and 
sustainable economic development of our country. In accordance with the 
MSME Policy 2012, the development of CSIs will be promoted through six 
broad objectives:


1. Strengthen the policy environment and institutional framework

2. Strengthen the legislative framework and enterprise environment 

3. Facilitate access to finance and incentives

4. Enhance competitiveness and innovation

5. Enhance employment and develop a culture of entrepreneurship

6. Improve market access

• Geological Mapping, Mineral Exploration and Sustainable Mineral 
Development: The demand for industrial minerals and construction 
materials will increase rapidly over the next few decades and therefore, 
the mineral sector will continue to play an important role in Bhutan’s socio-
economic development. The department will prioritize the target areas for 
mineral investigation and construction materials study. For ensuring mineral 
development, the Department will further strengthen both technical and 
human capacity of the government and private sector. Scientific mining 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

will be ensured through improvement of the regulatory framework and 
strengthening its implementation.
• Geo-scientific Studies and Risk Assessment of Geo-hazards: Bhutan is 
highly vulnerable to all forms of geo-hazards such as GLOFs, earthquake, 
landslides and flash floods owing to the fragile geology, active tectonics and 
climate change. Comprehensive geo-scientific studies and geo-hazard risk 
assessment is needed to address the threat posed by these geo-hazards. An 
earthquake monitoring network has already been initiated. The Eleventh 
Plan will focus on strengthening this initiative, including through the 
strengthening of human and institutional capacity to undertake studies and 
risk assessments. The geophysical investigation of potential groundwater 
reserves will be carried out. The validation of potentially dangerous lakes 
in the northern frontiers of Bhutan Himalayas will be carried out annually.

 5.8 Hydropower, Renewable Energy and Hydromet Sector

The energy sector is the lynchpin of our economy and accounts for about 18 
percent of total revenues and about 20 percent of GDP. Bhutan has an estimated 
hydropower potential of 23,760 MW with a mean annual energy production 
capability close to 100,000 GWh. At present, the installed hydropower capacity is 
1,488 MW, about 5 percent of the total potential. 

The main thrust area for the Energy sector in the Eleventh Plan is “Energy Security 
for Sustainable Development”.

5.8.1 Current Situation

Currently, construction of 1,020 MW Punatsangchhu I Hydroelectric Project, 
1,000 MW Punatsangchhu II and 720 MW Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Projects are 
ongoing. All three projects are scheduled to be completed by 2017-18. 

The other projects, to achieve 10,000 MW hydroelectricity generations by 2020, 
are planned to start construction during the current Plan period. The construction 
period ranges from 8-9 years.

To ensure electricity for all and for inclusive growth, the government has actively 
pursued rural electrification since the Sixth Plan (1988-1993). Till date 82,270 
households have been electrified out of the total of 88,642 households in the 
country resulting in overall electrification coverage of 92.82 percent.

Besides mega hydroelectricity plants, the installed capacity from renewable energy 
technologies is about 8,152 kW (solar PV contributing 152 kW and from small hydro 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

projects 8,000 kW). Further, about 900 biogas plants and 10 solar heating systems 
were promoted as part of the programme to promote alternate renewable energy.

The domestic electricity tariff was revised recently in October 2013 and in spite 
of about 15-20 percent increase for different categories of consumers, it is still 
the lowest in the region. For example45, in the neighbouring Indian state of West 
Bengal, the lifeline block, meant for rural households, has a cap of 75 units, with a 
tariff of Rs 3.19 a unit. In the bordering state of Assam, the lifeline block is capped 
at 30 units and the tariff is Rs 2.75 a unit. The cap for low voltage (LV) users in 
West Bengal is 350 units, with tariff averaging at Rs 5.69 a unit. For the same 
category, the tariff is Rs 4.59 a unit in Assam. When it comes to medium voltage 
(MV) consumers, the tariff is Rs 6.97 a unit in West Bengal, and Rs 3.25 a unit in 
Assam. High voltage (HV) consumers or factories in West Bengal pay Rs 6.13 a unit, 
while in Assam it is Rs 4.18 a unit

A new element in the revised electricity tariff is that rural consumers are provided 
free electricity for first 100 units for the next three years. This was done to 
encourage the rural community to use electricity to cut down use of firewood for 
environmental and health reasons.

5.8.2 Key Challenges

The high upfront investment costs required for developing hydro-power projects 
pose significant challenge in terms of raising financing for the project. The 
Government of India has agreed to provide the required financing and also buy any 
surplus power through the Umbrella Agreement on Development of Hydropower 
Projects signed between the two governments in 2006 and a Protocol to the 2006 
agreement signed in 2009. The pace of hydropower project development will 
however depend on the availability of financing. 

The extensive rural electrification programme to supply electricity to all households 
through grid and non-grid supply carried out since the Sixth Plan has resulted 
in substantial increase in number of domestic consumers and the demand for 
electricity. Maintaining the balance between the needs of domestic consumption 
and export earnings, meeting the demand by households and industries, and the 
cost of electricity supply and viability of tariff levels will be a challenge till new 
hydropower projects are commissioned. 

Other challenges that need to be addressed include infrastructure development, 
system reinforcement and human resource capacity.

Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) – Bhutan is home to 677 glaciers and 2,674 
glacial lakes (Second National Communication, 2011). A recent study by Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) revealed that there are 2 potentially 
dangerous lakes, Thorthormi and Raphstreng, contrary to the figure of 25 lakes 
reported by International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICMOD) 
in 2001. 

The report indicates that the two lakes are about 30 meters apart separated by a 
shrinking moraine dam. If the barrier is broken the water body from Thorthormi 
would flow into Raphstreng creating the threat of a possible outburst flood. The 
combined volume of water from these two lakes are projected to produce about 
53 million cubic metres which would cause a flood three times more powerful than 
the 1994 flood in Punakha from Luggye lake. However, the risk has been reduced 
substantially after the mitigation works undertaken in the Tenth Plan.

5.8.4 Strategies

Enhancing institutional and human capacity will be a critical strategy. The energy 
sector’s capacity to design, build, operate and manage hydropower projects will 
be developed through human resource development. Since hydro-meteorological 
services play an important role in development of hydroelectric projects, capacity 
to collect, analyses and interpret hydro-meteorological data will be strengthened. 
Other issues such as the benefits of separating transmission and distribution 
utilities and feasibility of establishing a Power Trading Company will be explored. 

Development of sustainable energy allocation policy - With the commissioning 
of new hydropower projects in the next few years, Bhutan’s firm power will be 
enhanced substantially. To prepare for the optimum utilization of firm power that 
would be available and to plan for clean green industrial development, energy 
allocation policy will be formulated. 

Development of Renewable Energy - To enhance energy security and reduce 
dependency on fossil fuel, other forms of alternate renewable energy will be 
promoted. Renewable energy (RE) master-plan will be developed to map RE 
potential and sites and feasibility studies will be conducted. 

5.8.5 Key Programmes 

• Accelerated Hydropower Generation & Transmission Network 
Strengthening – Major activities include new system infrastructures and 
system reinforcements to ensure reliability and security of domestic 
power supply; pre-feasibility studies and reconnaissance studies for new 
hydropower projects, implementation of pre-construction activities and 
construction of hydropower projects; establishment of a Power Training 
Institute to address manpower deployment in Hydropower projects; and 
construction of new transmission lines and associated substations by BPC.
• Enhancing Hydrological Network for Water Resources Assessment 
and Improvement of Flood Information/GLOF Early Warning System - 
Strengthening of hydrological information and establishing early warning 
networks and stations to reduce the risks of climate change induced 
disasters like floods, landslide, and droughts will be the focus.
• Strengthening Meteorological Network Coverage and Enhancing Weather 
and Climate Information Services - The current observation network in 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Bhutan is inadequate in terms of spatial coverage and representativeness. 
Hence, strengthening meteorological network coverage and enhancing 
weather and climate information services will be the focus.
• Promotion and Development of Renewable/Alternate Energy Technologies 
- The Programme aims to diversify energy supply mix using other renewable 
energy resources like solar, wind, biomass, small hydro and other emerging 
modern fuels for energy generation and to strengthen the institutional 
capacity for provision of efficient and responsive energy services in the 
Country. The Program intends to develop Renewable Energy Master Plan, 
conduct pre-feasibility and feasibility studies to attract the investors in the 
RE Sector. The Programme will promote biogas plants as alternate source of 
fuel for cooking, Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) instead of incandescent 
lamps in the LV category consumers, energy efficient wood stoves to reduce 
fuel-wood demand and solar water heating systems as alternative means 
for heating water and space. 


Programme details are presented in Eleventh Plan Volume II document.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

 5.9 Information, Communication & Technology 
and Media Sector

Information, Communication & Technology and Media play an important role 
in developing a more open, just and democratic societies. It is a key element 
for empowering people and enhancing transparency, accountability and good 
governance. The right to information as enshrined under Article 7(3) of the 
Constitution is a fundamental right of every Bhutanese citizen. Accordingly, the 
Right to Information Bill was tabled in the first session of the second Parliament in 
September 2013 and will be further deliberated during the next session.

ICT and Media are also critical “to promote a green and self reliant economy 
sustained by an IT enabled knowledge society guided by the philosophy of GNH” 
as underlined in the Economic Development Policy 2010 (EDP). The sector has 
been identified as one of the sectors for provision of high end green services such 
as Business Process Outsourcing (BPOs), Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPOs), 
Data Centres and other IT enabled services in health, education, finance etc. 

Given the importance of the sector, a number of initiatives have been implemented 
to strengthen the ICT backbone infrastructure, develop appropriate policy and 
legislation and enhance the technical capacity of ICT professionals. Further, an 
E-Gov Master Plan that has been developed to provide the strategic direction for 
development of the sector will be implemented during the Eleventh Plan. 

The main thrust in the Eleventh Plan will be to make the sector “affordable, reliable 
and sustainable” through implementation of the E-Gov Master Plan. The objective 
of the E-gov Master Plan is to consolidate and optimize the investments in various 
IT infrastructures during the Tenth Plan period for improved service delivery, 
enhanced access to services and information and facilitating good governance. 
The focus will be on consolidating the E-gov projects such as the G2C, establishing 
a government data centre, and further improving the nationwide intranet system – 
Thimphu Wide Area Network (TWAN) & Dzongkhag Local Area Network (DLANs) for 
smooth and seamless functioning of many of our online services. Special attention 
will be paid to tapping the potential of mobile technology for delivering services 
including for financial payments.

Policy: Bhutan Information, Communication and Media Act (BICMA) 2006 provide 
the overall legal framework for the development of ICT and media sector. The 
Act is being revised to incorporate provisions on cyber security, data protection, 
privacy, broadcasting etc. Further, the e-Gov Master Plan, Telecom & Broadband 
Policy, Media Policy, Film Policy and Advertisement Policy have been drafted and 
will be submitted to the government for approval in the Eleventh Plan. 

Infrastructure: Under the National Broadband Master plan project, optical 
fibers have currently reached all 20 Dzongkhags and 174 Gewogs. Except for 
four, the remaining Gewogs, will be connected by December 2013. The Second 
International Gateway has been established at Gelephu and operationalized to 
create the required redundancy. Direct high bandwidth connectivity to India, Nepal 
and Bangladesh is being established under SASEC Information Highway Project. 
More than 90 Government organizations are connected through the Thimphu 
Wide Area Network (TWAN). Of the 182 Community Centres (CCs) that have been 
established, 87 CCs have broadband internet connectivity as of June 2013 while 
the remaining will be connected in the Eleventh Plan. Computers are being made 
freely accessible to some rural communities to facilitate learning (HIWEL) and an 
IT Park was established in Babesa on 1st November 2011.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Telecommunications - All 205 Gewogs have access to mobile services and the 
remaining 10 villages will be connected by mobile services by the end of 2013. 
B-Mobile, a subsidiary of Bhutan Telecom Limited (BTL), and Tashi-Cell, a subsidiary 
of Tashi InfoComm Limited (TICL), are currently the two service providers offering 
mobile services with BTL being the sole provider of fixed-line telecommunication in 
the country. Internet services are provided by Druknet (under BTL), TICL, Samden 
Tech and Drukcom. 

e-Service Delivery - In the area of e-Services, a Government-to-Citizen (G2C) 
initiative is underway to implement 136 e-Services. 22 G2C e-services have been 
made available through the CCs that are connected with internet. 

5.9.2 Key Challenges

Telecom tariff – Telecommunication tariff will be an important consideration for 
investors to set-up BPOs, KPOs, Data Centre and IT enabled services. Currently, 
telecommunication tariffs in Bhutan are much higher than those in India with 
differences ranging from 114 percent for 1 mbps to 315 percent for 8 mbps. The 
high difference in tariff levels could negate Bhutan’s comparative advantage of 
political stability, clean environment and availability of cheap and reliable power. 
The tariff structure will be reviewed to make it more competitive and affordable.

International redundancy: International redundancy is defined as direct telecom 
infrastructural links with multiple countries. At present, all telecom links to the 
outside world are routed through Siliguri, India. Any operational failure in the 
telecom link through Siliguri could lead to connectivity problems46. An alternate 
telecom link with the outside world is necessary for international redundancy 
without which it may be difficult to position Bhutan as a potential hub for ICT and 
ICT enabled services. An alternate link through Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh will be 
explored.

Talent Pool - the strength of the ICT sector is primarily determined by availability of a rich 
pool of competent information and communications professionals. Currently, Bhutan 
has about 350 ICT professionals within the civil service. However, the sector still lacks 
qualified professionals particularly in specialized ICT skills such as network security, cyber 
laws, software development and programming. Creating a talent pool and strengthening 
ICT human resource management through parenting, clear career advancement 
opportunities and effective deployment and utilization of ICT personnel will be a priority.

 5.10 Transport Sector 

Transport sector covers surface and air transport. The surface transport is regulated by 
the Road Safety & Transport Act 1999 and air transport by the Civil Aviation Act 2000. 

The main thrust of the transport sector in the Eleventh Plan will be to ensure safe, 
efficient and reliable transport services. 

The focus of surface transport activities will be the implementation of the Bhutan 
Transport Strategies 2040. The primary objective of Bhutan Transport Strategy 
is to address the issue of growing traffic congestion particularly in Thimphu and 
Phuentsholing and improve access to reliable and safe public transport to all parts 
of the country. Also, emphasis will be placed on making our roads safer through 
extensive advocacy and education programmes. 

Air Transport activities will focus on expansion of facilities at Paro International Airport, 
enhance safety and regulatory system and upgradation of three domestic airports 
including the feasibility and construction of Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) airstrips.

5.10.1 Current Situation

Surface Transport – Surface transport is the main means of passengers and 
good transportation. The services were provided by the government till it was 
fully privatized in 1991. Today there are 21 operators managing a fleet of more 
than 209 buses operating on more than 73 routes47. The transport operators are 
provided interest subsidy of 60 percent on the loan as an incentive for operating in 
economically unviable routes.

To address urban transportation needs, a study on Bhutan Urban Transport 
Systems to assess the feasibility of introducing eco-friendly mass urban transport 
system using clean fuel for Thimphu and Phuentsholing has been completed. The 
study recommends Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), high capacity buses (60 seats) which 
meet European emission standards, for Thimphu to be implemented under Public 
Private Partnership model. In the meantime, city bus services in Thimphu will 
continue to be provided by Bhutan Post.

To enhance public service delivery, the web-based Registration and Licensing 
Information System (e-RaLIS) services were launched reducing the turnaround 
time for issuance of new driving licenses and renewals significantly.

Air transport – Aviation services in Bhutan commenced in 1983 with Druk Air 
flights to Kolkata with fleet of two 18-seat Dornier 228 aircraft. Since then, aviation 
services have expanded to ten international routes connecting Bhutan with India, 
Thailand, Nepal, Bangladesh and Singapore. Currently, Bhutan has signed Air Service 
Agreement (ASA) with India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar, Maldives 
and Singapore. Signing of ASA with the remaining SAARC countries (Pakistan, 
Afghanistan and Sri Lanka) have also been initiated with a larger plan to air-link all 
SAARC capitals. Similarly, ASA with South East Asian nations such as South Korea, 
Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia and Hong-Kong are being explored.

With the completion of construction of Yongphula, Bumthang and Gelephu airports, 
domestic air services was launched in 2011 by Druk Air and Tashi Air (first private domestic 
operator). However, the services to Yonphula has been suspended till 2014 to complete 
major development works and only chartered services are available to Gelephu.

Druk Air provides international and domestic air services with a fleet of three 
A319 and one ATR 42-500. Tashi Air Private Limited, a private airline which started 
domestic services with one Pilatus PC-12, has since October 2013 started operating 
between Paro and Bangkok with one Airbus A320.

Air cargo transported was 620,000 tons in 2012. 

5.10.2 Key Challenges

Surface transport – Road safety is a major issue with number of vehicles increasing 
every year. Over the last five years the number of vehicles has almost doubled 
with 90 percent of vehicles registered under Thimphu and Phuentsholing regions. 
With increase in number of vehicles, the number of motor vehicles accidents has 
also been on the rise with figures increasing from 696 in 200548 to 1,730 in 2011. 
Thimphu and Chukha Dzongkhags tops the accident list with light vehicles leading 
the category of vehicles involved in accidents.

Moreover, since the transport functions are carried out by number of agencies 
– highway construction and maintenance by the Department of Roads, urban 
roads by Thromde, traffic management by the Royal Bhutan Police, licensing/
vehicle fitness by the Road Safety Transport Authority – issues of coordination and 
implementation is a challenge. 

Air transport – Air travel is the most efficient means of travel to and from Bhutan, 
particularly for tourists, business travelers, foreign investors and medical referrals 
patients, the alternate being travel by road through India. At present, Paro 
International Airport caters to 160,000 passengers annually, an average of 450 
passengers per day, 3800 scheduled flights annually, and about 10 flights daily in 
and out of Paro. A key issue is the capacity of Paro airport to serve double the 
number of passengers, flights and air cargo in the Eleventh Plan. 

With the expansion of aviation sector, the Department of Civil Aviation is confronted 
with a key challenge of retaining its professionals who are being offered better 
remuneration and service conditions by the airline companies. Further, conflicting 
functions of regulation and implementation being carried out by the department is 
creating potential for conflict of interest. Therefore, retention of professionals and 
separation of conflicting function are critical issues that need to be reviewed and 
addressed in the Eleventh Plan.

5.10.4 Strategies

The surface transport is regulated by the Road Safety & Transport Act 1999 and air 
transport by the Civil Aviation Act 2000. Since both Acts were legislated more than 
a decade ago they will be reviewed and revised during the current Plan period.

Surface Transport – Access to public transportation, particularly in rural areas, 
will be expanded by incentivizing transport operators through special subsidies. In 
urban areas, eco-friendly mass public transportation services will be introduced to 
reduce road congestion, vehicle emissions and improve public service efficiency. 
Road safety will be strengthened by improving driver licensing procedures, motor 
vehicle fitness standards, public safety awareness campaigns (especially on drink 
driving and over-speeding) and equipping road safety authorities with necessary 
equipments and tools to monitor road safety. 

To address the issue of coordination and implementation, integration and 
streamlining of transport activities under one agency will be explored. 

Air Transport – The key strategy will be to strengthen Paro International Airport 
through expansion of infrastructure facilities and upgradation of security and 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

navigational equipment to increase its capacity to handle more passengers, cargo 
and flights. At the same time, upgradation of Gelephu to an international airport 
will also be explored. Further, improvements of the three domestic airports will be 
carried out to enhance safety and reliability and to facilitate increased domestic air 
transport. Bhutan will continue to pursue further signing of Air Service Agreements 
to expand air services to and from international destinations.

The retention of professionals will be addressed through a comprehensive review 
of civil service system and conflicting functions will be addressed by exploring ways 
to ensure greater independence and autonomy of the Department of Civil Aviation. 
Further, the legal and policy instruments will be reviewed and strengthened.

Alternate modes of transport – To ease the pressure on air and surface transport, 
alternate modes of transporting passengers and goods will be explored such as 
waterway, ropeway, cable cars and railway links. Furthermore, the government 
is already exploring piloting of electric powered taxis to address environmental 
issues and reduce dependency on fossil fuel. 

5.10.5 Key Programmes

• Surface Transport Development - the programme will focus on the 
implementation of Bhutan Transport Strategies 2040, and in particular 
address the issues of traffic congestion in the major Thromdes by setting 
up the Bus Rapid Transport systems in Thimphu and Phuentsholing. In 
addition, alternate modes of transport will also be explored for the purpose 
of controlling the carbon emission.
• Development of Air Transport - the programme will focus on further 
expansion of the Paro International Airport to deal with the expansion in 
air traffic and passengers, as well as strengthen the domestic airports to 
optimize their functionality.
• Promotion of electric vehicles will be pursued to address environmental 
issues and reduce dependency on fossil fuel. 


Programme details are presented in Eleventh Plan Volume II document.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

 5.11 Roads & Bridges Sector

For a landlocked country, a good network of road and bridges play a critical role 
in facilitating trade, transit, reducing the high cost of transportation normally 
associated with mountainous countries and for delivery of socio-economic services 
particularly to scattered and far-off rural communities. 

Recognizing the importance of the roads and bridges sector, Bhutan started its 
first Five Year Plan in 1961 with the construction of the first national highway - 
Phuentsholing-Thimphu highway. Since then the network of roads and bridges 
have expanded significantly and today all twenty Dzongkhags are connected by 
road. 

The Department of Roads is the national authority responsible for all roads in the 
country. For roads in a Thromde, the Thromde Administration is responsible for 
the administration and management of all roads, constructed or maintained by it, 
including any access roads. Similarly, for roads in the Dzongkhag and Gewog, the 
Dzongkhag administration is responsible for the administration and management 
of all roads constructed or maintained by it, including access roads. For farm roads 
technical specification, guidelines and manuals are provided by the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Forest. 

The strategic framework for the construction, expansion and maintenance of road 
infrastructure up to the year 2027 is guided by the Road Sector Master Plan (RSMP). 

The main thrust of the roads and bridges sector in the Eleventh Plan will be to 
complete the national highway grid using environment friendly technology, 
construction and upgradation of roads connecting to hydro-power projects and to 
enhance the safety, reliability and quality of roads. 

5.11.1 Current Situation

Bhutan’s road transportation network is classified into five categories as follows:

• National Highways – consisting of Asian Highway/International Road 
(currently Phuentsholing-Thimphu Highway), Primary National Highway 
(existing East-West Highway and North-South highways) and Secondary 
National Highway (currently District Roads); 
• Dzongkhag Roads (currently feeder Roads); 


05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

• Farm Roads (currently Farm Roads and Power Tiller Roads); 
• Thromde Roads (currently Urban Roads); and 
• Access Roads.


Currently, Bhutan has 10,578.26 kilometers of various categories of roads, 
337 numbers of bridges totaling 10,604.5 meters and 380 pedestrian bridges 
nationwide.

5.11.2 Key Challenges

Most of the existing primary and secondary national highways, including the 
Northern East-West highway, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s when the 
traffic volume was low with the primary objective of providing connectivity to 
settlements. With increase in traffic volume, road safety has become a growing 
challenge.

Additionally, financial sustainability in terms of improving the specification of 
the existing roads, maintenance costs and blacktopping cost of unpaved roads is 
another challenge. To improve access particularly in rural areas, extensive network 
of Gewog Connectivity roads have been constructed and many of these roads 
are unpaved. A preliminary assessment of blacktopping about 2,000 kilometers 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

of Gewog Connectivity roads would cost about Nu. 13 billion. The ADB’s Country 
Diagnostic Study 2012 estimates that while the density of road has doubled from 
about 1.5 km/km² in 2005 to 3 km/km² in 2011, the percentage of paved roads have 
decreased from about 55 percent to about 35 percent during the same period.

network. To reduce travel time and costs and to enhance road safety, road 
specifications and standards will be improved and geometric improvements and 
regular maintenance of road will be carried out. The government will also explore 
possibilities of tunneling certain stretches of the highways through PPP wherever 
feasible. The involvement of the private sector in the maintenance of roads will 
also be explored in order to ensure financial sustainability.

 5.12 Construction Sector

The construction sector plays a vital role in the delivery of quality infrastructure 
which is essential for our socio-economic development. It is also a key sector in 
terms of its contribution to economic growth and employment. The key agencies 
responsible for the development of construction sector are:

Department of Engineering Services (DES): DES was created in 2011 by bifurcating 
the erstwhile Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) 
into Department of Engineering Services (DES) and Department of Human Settlement 
(DHS). DES is responsible for promoting construction technology, providing technical 
backstopping to the other ministries, Dzongkhag Administrations and Thromdes and 
supporting professional development of all the engineers. 

Construction Development Board (CDB): CDB is a bridge between the government 
and the construction industry and is responsible for facilitating development of a 
vibrant construction industry. Its core functions include registration, classification 
and monitoring of contractors, consultants and engineers/architects. 

Construction Development Corporation Limited (CDCL): CDCL was established 
on 1st July 2006 as a public sector company owned by the Royal Government of 
Bhutan with the following objectives: 

• Enhance efficiency, mechanization, improve standards and create a good 
benchmark of quality infrastructure in the construction sector. 
• Lead the modernization of the construction industry through the 
introduction of appropriate machineries and technologies, including the 
maintenance of an equipment bank of machines not easily available in the 
market to support the government and the private sector.
• Participate in the booming construction industry, introducing technology 
intensive construction and building capacity of local construction industry 
through collaborations.
• Generate employment and at the same time develop necessary skills 
for skilled and unskilled national manpower, thereby gradually reducing 
dependence on the expatriate work force.


The private sector is represented by the Construction Association of Bhutan under 
the Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI). Its membership includes 
all firms under the construction industry. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The sector has come a long way with establishment of various agencies and 
introduction of many new initiatives towards making the sector more efficient and 
effective. However, poor quality of construction, human resource constraints and 
high construction costs continue to affect the sector. The main thrust in the Eleventh 
Plan will, therefore, be on enhancing the quality of construction through efficient 
and appropriate technology, mechanization and human resource development.

5.12.1 Current Situation

The construction sector contributed about 16 percent of nominal GDP and recorded 
an annual growth of 35 percent in 2011. The sector’s contribution is expected 
to increase in the coming years with accelerated development of hydro-power 
projects. In terms of employment less than 5,00049 Bhutanese were employed by 
the construction sector in 2012.

The contractor classification was re-categorized to increase flexibility and to allow 
contractors to participate in larger contract. Currently there are about 3,892 
registered contractors, of which 120 are large (above Nu. 15 million), 380 medium 
(Nu. 4-15 million) and 3,392 small (under Nu. 4 million) contractors. About 127 
Bhutanese contractors, in various categories, are engaged in the construction of 
three ongoing hydropower projects. Besides construction companies, there are 
about 63 architects and 46 construction related consultants in Bhutan50.

5.12.2 Key Challenges

Construction sector perceived poorly for employment: With three new hydropower 
projects under construction and seven new projects planned to be started in the 
Eleventh Plan, there are ample opportunities for addressing unemployment. 
However, construction sector jobs are perceived as inferior by many Bhutanese 
and as a result foreign workers51 are brought in to fill the gap. Some of the reasons 
for this perception are low wages, lack of job security (workers have to find a new 
job once the construction project is completed), low level of mechanization and 
the manual nature of work. 

51About 22,000 foreign workers were employed by hydropower projects (labour net, 2012).



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Limited capacity and poor quality: The shortage of engineers, architect and other 
qualified professionals combined with a lack of basic tools and technology for 
effective planning, designing and supervision results in frequent changes in the 
scope of work and consequently the cost of construction projects. It is estimated 
that Bhutanese construction projects are 15-20 percent more costly and take 
50 percent longer to complete compared to similar construction work by Indian 
contractors on similar projects. 90 percent of all construction projects in Bhutan 
have time and cost overruns as compared to 40 percent in India and 5 percent in 
best-in-class countries52. Further, due to poor quality of construction, the cost of 
maintenance is expected to be double the industry standard.

Mechanization of construction sector, use of local construction materials, centrally fixed 
rate contracts for some key materials (like cement, steel, bitumen etc.) will be pursued 
in order to avail institutional-buyer-discounts to reduce the cost of construction. 

To encourage youth to work in the construction sector special service conditions 
such as job security and better wages will be explored. Vocational training 
programmes will be aligned to the needs of construction industry and will include 
apprenticeships and on-the-job trainings. Vocational training graduates will be 
encouraged to form their own construction firms and the government will provide 
necessary support for start-ups. 

5.12.5 Key programmes

• Promotion and Strengthening of Construction Sector: The Construction 
Development Board (CDB) will concentrate on promoting efficient and quality 
based construction sector. These will be carried out through awareness 
programs among the contractors and mechanization. The benefits of creating 
an autonomous Construction Development Authority (CDA) to be able to 
discharge its roles and responsibilities efficiently will be explored.
• Engineering Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction: The major activities to 
be undertaken during the plan period are construction of flood protection 
walls and land reclamation along major flooding rivers, disaster risk 
assessment and mapping and development of guidelines and manuals. 
Flood risk assessment and vulnerability mapping will also be carried out. 
These are aimed to reduce the vulnerability of people and places to floods. 
• Technical support and management for infrastructure development and 
engineering services: The Department of Engineering Services will provide 
technical backstopping to all government agencies and Thromdes. It will 
promote the construction of MICE facilities through PPP. The construction 
of water reservoirs in water stressed towns will also be initiated. The 
development of regional hubs and centers in eastern Bhutan to promote 
regional balanced development will be carried out.
• Technical support for construction and maintenance of suspension bridges 
and mule tracks: There are still many communities who need trail suspension 
bridges as a principle means of transport. The Department of Engineering 
Services (DES) will also initiate the construction of bazams and maintenance 
and technical backstopping for the construction of trail suspension bridges.

 5.13 Human Settlement & Housing Sector

Human Settlement: Until recently, the focus of this sector was mainly on urban 
development to meet the needs arising from the rising trends in rural-urban 
migration and rapid pace of urbanization, particularly in the two major towns of 
Thimphu and Phuentsholing. The Bhutan National Urbanization Strategy 2008 
estimates that the average annual growth of urban population in Bhutan during 
2000-2005 was 7.3 percent, with Thimphu city experiencing the highest growth at 
12.6 percent. This rapid growth in urban population has created severe pressure 
on existing facilities leading to problems of water shortages, lack of sanitation 
and waste disposal facilities etc. To address these problems, a number of urban 
development programmes, particularly in Thimphu and Phuentsholing, have 
been implemented over the last decade. However, in spite of major infrastructure 
expansion, the rural-urban migration trend continues and urban centres continue 
to face difficulties in provision of urban services. Further, expansion of the existing 
services is also constrained by limited land availability in urban areas. In the 
meantime, large scale unplanned developments near urban areas are taking place. 

In order to address the issues of rapid urbanization and unplanned development 
a new Department of Human Settlement (DHS) was created by bifurcating the 
erstwhile Department of Urban Development and Engineering Services into 
two separate departments in 2011. The Department of Human Settlement is 
responsible for preparation of human settlement policies, strategies and plans. 

The main thrust of the human settlement sector will be to develop strategic human 
settlements with a focus on balanced regional development and improving the 
quality of life and socio economic status of both urban and rural residents. 

Housing: The National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL) was 
established on 15 July 2003 to promote and develop housing in Bhutan in line with 
the National Housing Policy 2002. It was corporatized in 2009. 

The main thrust of housing sector in the Eleventh Plan will be to provide safe, 
adequate and affordable housing to all and promote homeownership. Where 
feasible, participation of the private sector will be encouraged.

5.13.1 Current Situation

Human Settlement: – Till recently, priority was accorded to planning and development 
of urban centres and not on human settlements. However, the emergence of 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

unplanned settlements near the urban areas is constraining urban expansions and 
provision of service facilities. Therefore, DHS was mandated to develop settlement 
plans that take into consideration the planning of an entire region. 

As of now, comprehensive human settlement plans do not exist, other than structural 
and local area plans for settlements classified as i) Class A Thromdes – Thimphu, 
Phuentsholing, Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar; ii) Class B Thromdes – Dzongkhag 
centre; and iii) Yenlag Throm. The criteria for various categories of towns are as follows:

Class A Thromdes should have a resident population of more than 10,000 with 
population density of 1,000 persons or more per square kilometers. The area 
should not be less than 5 square kilometers and should have revenue base sufficient 
to finance the establishment and maintenance of infrastructure and provision of 
services. It should have a national administrative significance such as being the 
capital city or a town that services more than one Dzongkhag.

Class B Thomdes should have a resident population of more than 5000 with population 
density of 300 persons or more per square kilometers. The area should not be less than 
1 square kilometer. It should have significant commercial, industrial or institutional 
centre and at least 50 percent of the population dependent on non-primary activities.

Yenlag Throm should have a resident population of more than 1500 and area not 
less than 50 acres. 

In 2010, the Parliament approved four Class A Thromdes and 18 Class B Thromdes. 
Yenlag Throms are yet to be approved. 

Housing: The sector is guided by the Housing Policy 2002. Currently, there are 
1,122 housing units across the country for rental and 32 apartments in Changjiji 
allotted under homeownership programme to low income groups. 

BLSS 2012 reports that 85 percent of the households in the rural areas lived in houses 
whereas almost three-fourths of urban households (73 percent) lived either in part of 
a house or in an apartment. It also indicates that about 60 percent of the household 
owned their own dwellings, out of which 83 percent households were in rural areas 
and 17 percent in urban areas. 62 percent of households in urban areas rented their 
dwellings. The private sector is the largest provider of dwellings for rent, especially in 
the urban areas, where its rentals comprise 43 percent of dwellings. About one-fifth 
of urban dwellings are owned by the government and public corporations.

Among the Dzongkhags, Pemagatshel had the highest proportion of households 
that own their dwellings (91 percent) and Thimphu the lowest with 19 percent. 
The proportion of households that own their dwellings is below 60 percent in only 
three other Dzongkhags: Chhukha (43 percent), Sarpang (52 percent), and Paro 
(58 percent). In Thimphu, three-fifths of households rent and one-fifth live in rent- 
free dwellings; 80 percent of the rent-paying households live in dwellings owned 
by private individuals; and 18 percent live in housing owned by the government 
and public corporations.

Households in the poorest per capita consumption quintile paid a house rent of Nu 
1,217 a month, on average, while the richest households pay about Nu 4,487. The 
average monthly rental is highest in Thimphu and Wangduephodrang (about Nu 
5,000) and lowest (about Nu. 900) in Gasa and Lhuentse.

5.13.2 Key Challenges

Human Settlement – In absence of a clear legislation such as the National Spatial 
Planning Act and the National Human Settlement Policy it is difficult to plan, 
coordinate and implement human settlement strategy. 

The sector also faces acute shortage of human resources. While the department has 
urban planners, urban designers, architects, infrastructure planner and engineers, the 
numbers are not adequate. Moreover, lack of qualified and experienced GIS professionals, 
municipal engineers, urban economists, sociologists, planning lawyers, investment 
planners and environmentalists limit the sector to address complex urban issues. 

Further, other issues such as timely availability of land, resources to implement 
structural and local area plans and resistance to introduction of new/revision of 
taxes, hamper strategic human settlement development. 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Housing – National Housing Development Corporation was established in 2003 
to implement the National Housing Policy 2002 objective of providing safe and 
affordable housing for all. A decade after its establishment not much progress 
has been made considering the present housing stock of 1,122 units which 
includes units/bungalows constructed in 1970s and 1980s. Places like Thimphu, 
Phuentsholing, Gasa, Lhuentse and Samdrup Jongkhar have severe housing 
shortages. As a result, many Bhutanese in Phuentsholing are forced to live across 
the border and in places like Gasa and Lhuentshe civil servants are living in 
temporary makeshift houses due to lack of proper housing. 

The challenge is not only in terms of increasing the housing stock but also making 
it affordable particularly for the low and middle income group. The high cost of 
financing and raw materials makes construction expensive resulting in higher 
rents. NHDC’s assessment indicate that low income people spend about 50-60 
percent of their income on house rent in Thimphu and Phuentsholing against an 
ideal proportion of 30 percent of income.

5.13.4 Strategies

Human Settlement – To ensure sustainable development of human settlements, 
new legislation and policies will be formulated and existing rules and regulations 
reviewed and improved. Development of valley plans, regional hub plans and rural 
urban development plans will be accelerated in order to contain the rural urban 
migration. Capacity strengthening of engineers, architects and planners will be 
given emphasis. 

Housing: NHDC will explore new technologies and design innovation to reduce 
the cost of construction while ensuring high quality. Over the next five years, 
about 800 new units of low income housing for rental will be constructed across 
the country. To promote homeownership, about 100 units will be constructed 
which will be allotted to low income civil servants based on modalities such as 
direct purchase, lease, and purchase and installment payment basis depending 
on the purchasing capacity of the beneficiaries. Given the limited resources of the 
government, partnership with private sector for the provision of low-cost housing 
will also be explored.

5.13.5 Key Programmes

• Enhancing human settlement in Bhutan: The development of settlement 
has been accorded high priority in past plans but the efforts were mostly 
concentrated in urban areas. With the creation of the Department of Human 
Settlement (DHS), focus will be accorded equally to both urban and rural 
settlements. The major activities in the Eleventh Plan are development of 
valley development plans, urban development plans and rural development 
plans. The environment and disaster resilient aspects will be incorporated 
while developing the structural and local area plans. 
• Promotion of affordable housing and home ownership: The NHDC will 
construct affordable housing particularly in Dzongkhags/towns like 
Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar, Lhuentse and Gasa where 
housing shortage is a major problem.

 5.14 Emerging Social Challenges

With development, Bhutan is confronted with new social challenges such as those 
related to youth, senior citizens, single parents, orphans, differently-abled persons, 
domestic violence and crime. The rising rural-urban migration, changing urban 
lifestyle and exposure to information and media are giving rise to breakdowns 
in family relationships, drug abuse, crime and youth related problems. While 
insufficient data makes it difficult to assess the scale of these challenges, they 
cannot be ignored. Many urban areas are already confronted with these challenges 
and for the first time the Eleventh Plan pays special attention to these issues. 

5.14.1 Current Situation

Institutional set-up - Currently, the Ministries of Health and Education are taking the 
initiative to address issues related to youth, orphans, differently abled person, and 
senior citizen issues. The other agency responsible is the National Commission for 
Women and Children which was established in 2004 to fulfill Bhutan’s obligations 
towards the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The Office 
of Gyalpoi Zimpon has also been providing support to the underprivileged youths, 
orphans and senior citizens in the form of monthly stipends and rations. 

Besides, there are a number of civil society organizations (CSO) and associations 
working in these areas such as:

• Youth Development Fund, which was established as a CSO in 1999 to provide 
financial support for youth development activities like leadership skills, drug 
rehabilitation, special education, basic skills and vocational training, advocacy 
research and education.
• Tarayana Foundation, which was established in 2003 to help the poor and 
disadvantaged communities become self reliant through programmes aimed 
at building local capacities, providing scholarships, facilitating micro-finance 
and housing improvement. 
• RENEW (Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women), which was 
established as a CSO in 2004 and is dedicated to the empowerment of women 
and girls in Bhutan, especially victims of domestic and gender based violence. 
RENEW provides counseling, temporary and long-term shelters, legal assistance 
and need-based provision of vocational training in selected skills and micro-




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

enterprises as a way of providing opportunities to help transform lives of many 
women.
• Draktsho Vocational Training Centre for Special Children and Youth, established 
in 2001 as a CSO to empower disabled youth through training for their 
eventual integration into the mainstream population. Its main focus is to equip 
the trainees with vocational skills to enhance their opportunities for gainful 
employment. It also aims to build their self-esteem and self-reliance, thereby 
making them more independent, confident and contributing members of the 
society.
• Ability Bhutan Society, established in 2011 as a public benefit organization 
(PBO). It provides services and facilities to address the needs of families and 
individuals with multiple impairments, especially children living with mental 
retardation, cerebral palsy, autism and multiple disabilities. 
• Royal Society for Senior Citizens, established as a CSO in 2011 to enhance 
human security especially amongst its old age citizens. 
• Lhak-Sam, established by a group of HIV positive people in September 2009 
and registered as CSO in 2010. Its main aim is to promote a strong support 
system based on solidarity, social networking and people’s participation for 
addressing and taking collective action towards effective responses to HIV/
AIDS and its impact.


Enabling Environment – The various articles of the Constitution, in particular Article 
7 and 9, protect the rights of an individual, women and children and mandates 
the State to take appropriate measures to eliminate all form of discrimination and 
exploitation. 

Domestic laws such as Child Adoption Act 2012, Child Care and Protection Act of 
Bhutan 2011, Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and Substance Abuse Act 2005 
and Rape Act 1996 have been enacted to protect the rights and welfare of individuals.

At the international level, Bhutan is a signatory to the Convention on Elimination 
of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CE DAW), Convention of Rights of 
the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 

Existing Facilities – The National Institute for the Visually Impaired established in 
1973 was the first institution established for special needs children. Subsequently, 

05

CENTRAL PLAN



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

a number of institutions/facilities have been created for differently-abled person. 
The Ministry of Education has established Changangkha Lower Secondary School in 
2001 as an integrated school providing special needs education and education for 
the hearing impaired was introduced in Drukgyel Lower Secondary School in 2003. 
In addition, there are six other schools catering to the special needs education. The 
Ministry has also introduced the Inclusive Education programme for children with 
Special Education Needs (SEN) and has established a division for Special Education 
Needs under the Department of School Education. The Annual Education Statistic 
2012 reports that there are about 343 students and 177 teachers in the eight 
special education schools. 

RENEW provides shelter homes and safe houses for the victims of family violence and 
their children which operate 24 hours a day. The shelter provides emergency protection, 
food and lodging, emergency medical care, crisis intervention and counseling.

Draktsho provides vocational courses on tailoring, embroidery, weaving, etc. and 
life skills such as personal management skills, sign language, safety skills, etc. to 
differently-abled persons. 

Youth Development Fund supports women’s Nazhoen Pelri Treatment and 
Rehabilitation Centre for Drugs and Alcohol Dependence, located in Serbithang 
and a number of drop in centres for alcohol and/or drug dependent people 

Royal Bhutan Police established the Youth Development and Rehabilitation Center 
in Tshimasham in 1999 with the aim to provide reformative training for juveniles 
in conflict with the law.

Differently-abled persons: According to the two stage child disability (aged 2-9 years) 
study53 carried out by NSB in 2012, the prevalence of any form disability54 was 21 percent. 
If mild disability was excluded then the prevalence of moderate or severe disability 
clubbed together was about three (2.7) percent. The prevalence of disability55 
was higher among the age group 2-5 years. The prevalence of cognitive disability56 
was highest with 15 percent, followed by behavior disability 5.6 percent and fine motor 
5.5 percent.

53Out of sample size of 11,370 children, 3,500 children were screened as having potentially 
functional impairment.

54Difficulty in 8 functional domains: gross motor, fine motor, vision, hearing, speech, cognition, 
behavior and seizures. 

55Intellectual or specific learning disability.

Domestic violence – Records with RENEW indicate that cases of domestic violence 
are on the rise with a total of 1,141 cases reported till now in the country. In the 
last three to four years about 300-400 cases are reported annually. 

5.14.2 Key Challenges

There is no one overall agency within the government responsible for coordination 
of these emerging issues. Many of the issues are being currently addressed based 
on the initiative of various sectors or CSOs/association. Further, while there are a 
number of CSO/associations established to address these issues, many of these 
CSO/authorities lack technical and financial resources to be able to comprehensively 
address issue. Therefore, resources and coordination is a major problem.

Also, there are very few studies, baseline data, surveys etc to get a clear 
understanding of the situation and to recommend appropriate interventions. 
Therefore, it is difficult to recommend concrete result oriented programmes to 
address these issues in the Eleventh Plan. 

5.14.3 Strategies 

In order to assess the current situation and plan appropriate interventions, a more 
detailed study on the issues will be carried out. Strategies and programmes will be 
formulated based on these studies. The government’s intervention will be through 
broad-based programmes and prioritizing issues within sectoral programmes. 
Within the framework of Civil Society Act 2007 and based on comparative 
advantage of the CSOs, the government will work in close partnership with the 
various CSOs to address these issues.

 5.15 Sports

Recognizing the positive contribution of games and sports in addressing lifestyle 
related health problems, strengthening community vitality, and preventing juvenile 
delinquency, amongst other benefits, the promotion and development of sports 
will be actively pursued in the Eleventh Plan. 

While efforts to promote and develop sports date back to the early seventies 
with the establishment of the National Sports Association in 1972 and the Bhutan 
Olympic Committee (BOC) in November 1983, a focused and coherent development 
of sports has remained lacking.

To address this challenge, the BOC undertook a comprehensive situational analysis 
of the sports sector in 2009 and further, based on the first ever nation-wide Bhutan 
Sports Baseline Survey 2010 (BSBS, 2010) formulated a Strategic Road Map for the 
development of organized sports in Bhutan

The main thrust in the Eleventh Plan will be to establish a representative and organized 
sports sector that will be able to deliver sports and recreation to all and promote a 
vibrant sporting culture. Investments in sports infrastructure will receive priority. 

5.15.1 Current Situation

The Ministry of Education, BOC and its 15 affiliated National Sport Federations, volunteers 
and sports enthusiasts have been responsible for promoting sports in Bhutan.

The federations representing various sports are athletics, archery, badminton, 
basketball, boxing, body building and weight lifting, cricket, football, golf, indigenous 
games and sports, table tennis, taekwondo, tennis, shooting and volleyball.

About 80 percent of all existing sports facilities in the country are owned by schools 
and other institutions and many of these facilities are either poorly maintained or 
are not accessible to local communities. In Thimphu, the BOC manages various sports 
facilities (the national stadium including the archery range, taekwondo training 
centre, Olympic archery range, synthetic athletic track and field arena, table tennis 
hall) even though BOC does not have legal ownership over these facilities.

5.15.2 Key Challenges

The major challenges include lack of infrastructure facilities, human resources 
capacity and financial sustainability.

The main strategy will be the implementation of the “Strategic Vision and Road 
Map for Development of Sports in Bhutan” by the BOC. The government will 
facilitate the implementation of the road map by ensuring enabling conditions 
for development of sports in the form of access to land, mainstreaming sports in 
sector/local government policies and programmes, incentives and participation in 
national, regional and international sporting events.

 5.16 Preservation and Promotion of Culture

The preservation and promotion of culture is an important pillar of GNH and one 
that distinguishes Bhutan’s development. The focus is on strengthening our unique 
cultural identity to reinforce national cohesion and unity that are vital for peace, 
stability and sovereignty of our nation. Bhutan’s unique identity is reflected through 
its language, dress, architecture, etiquette, indigenous sports, and the everyday 
Bhutanese way of life. The traditional beliefs and customs stress respect for all 
sentient beings and encourage values such as tolerance, compassion, respect, and 
generosity. 

The Eleventh Plan also recognizes culture as an “evolving dynamic force” and the 
need “to strengthen and facilitate the continued evolution of traditional values 
and institutions that are sustainable as a progressive society57”. Futhermore, the 
preservation and promotion of culture is accorded priority not just for strengthening 
our identity but also as an economic imperative for tourism and to address poverty 
through the development of cultural industries. 

5.16.1 Current Situation

• Guidelines for conservation of heritage sites by all conservation projects have 
been developed and are under implementation. 
• Institutionalization of archaeology has been initiated with the establishment 
of an archaeology unit under the Ministry of Home & Cultural Affairs. 
• The National Library of Bhutan has been equipped with archiving and microfilming 
facilities of important historical documents and records. A Bill on Archives of 
Bhutan is being formulated to strengthen the national archives system. 
• To promote the national language, digital Dzongkha dictionary, Dzongkha 
keyboard layout in phones with Android software and Dzongkha support in 
phones with Maemo software (eg Nokia 900 series) have been developed. 
• The Royal Textile Academy in Thimphu, which will serve as a textile school, 
museum and conservation centre, was inaugurated in June 2013. 
• Bhutanese film and music industry is gaining increasing popularity and have 
completely edged out foreign films from local cinema halls. Since the first film

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Gasa Lamai Singye in 1988, the industry has now produced about 300 films 
with an average annual production of 30 films. Similarly, about 400 music 
albums have been marketed. The industry is making significant contribution 
towards promotion of national language, culture and traditions and in 
conveying important social messages on HIV, drugs and youth related issues.
• Craft Bazaar, with 80 stalls, was established in Thimphu in 2011 to showcase a 
wide range of authentic Bhutanese arts and crafts. It has facilitated in creation 
of a viable market for rural artisans to market their products.
• The certification system, ‘Made in Bhutan Seal’, was launched in May 2012. 
The seal authenticates wholly produced and/or substantially transformed 
products with required minimum value addition within Bhutan. 
• Interventions to set-up craft clusters based on regional comparative advantages, 
raw-material banks, design banks, product development and marketing are being 
undertaken by newly established Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts.


5.16.2 Key Challenges

Overall, a plan or framework which brings together in one place all aspects of 
culture and traditions as well as the gaps and challenges is lacking. This is necessary 
to ensure that all aspects of culture and tradition get the required support as well 
as to coordinate the efforts made by various sectors.

Some of our local dialects, songs, dances, lozeys, festivals and rituals are in danger 
of extinction as there are very few people to keep these traditions alive. Those still 
practicing today are a small group of elderly people and together with them these 
traditions may also pass away one day. The younger generations are either not keen 
or do not have the skills to continue these traditions, many having left their village, 
as a result of rural-urban migration. Preserving, promoting and documenting the 
fading intangible cultural heritage are crucial.

In terms of the tangible cultural heritage, many of the rich historical, cultural and 
spiritual sites which existed for centuries are under threat from both natural and 
manmade disasters such as earthquakes, windstorms, landslides, vandalism and 
fire. Conservation, restoration, making these sites disaster resilience, inventorying 
of these monuments and capacity building in conservation practices have become 
necessary. The investment required for these activities are substantial and could 
pose a challenge. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Cultural industries have the potential to contribute to poverty alleviation by enhancing 
rural incomes. However, economies of scale, quality and access to markets are 
among the challenges that need to be addressed to harness this potential.

 5.17 Conservation of Environment

The conservation of environment (one of the four pillars of GNH) is an integral part 
of our development strategy to ensure that socio-economic development efforts 
do not come at the cost of our natural environment. Since 2009, all new policies 
introduced by the sectors are subject to GNH Policy Screening to assess the impact 
of a new policy on GNH. The GNH Policy Screening tool includes three variables58 
on environment from the total of twenty two variables to further enhance efforts 
to conserve our environment. 

Bhutan issued a declaration during the Fifteenth Conference of Parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2009 in 
Copenhagen, Denmark. Through the declaration entitled “Declaration of the 
Kingdom of Bhutan – The Land of Gross National Happiness to Save our Planet” 
the government has committed to maintain Bhutan’s status as a net sink for Green 
House Gasses by ensuring that greenhouse gas emission levels do not exceed the 
sequestration capacity of its forest. In this context, a National Strategy and Action 
Plan for Low Carbon Development has been formulated in 2012. 

Bhutan has been able to maintain its natural environment, much of it pristine, 
due to its strong commitment towards conservation of environment and through 
enactment of various legislations such as National Environment Protection 
Act, 2007, Environmental Assessment Act 2000, Regulation for Environmental 
Clearance of Projects and Regulation on Strategic Environmental Assessment 
2002, Waste Prevention and Management Act of Bhutan 2009, Waste Prevention 
and Management Regulation 2012 and Water Act of Bhutan 2011. 

5.17.1 Current Situation

Currently, the national forest coverage is about 70.5 percent, which exceeds 
the Constitutional requirement of maintaining 60 percent forest coverage at all 
times. The high level of forest coverage has allowed Bhutan to maintain negative 
carbon emissions. Presently, carbon emissions are about one third of the total 
sequestration capacity of our forest. 

Biological diversity - 51.32 percent of the country is under a protected area 
network which includes ten protected areas and biological corridors. Bhutan also 
falls within the top ten global biodiversity hotspots. The country has more than 

05

CENTRAL PLAN

58Water and air pollution, land degradation and bio-diversity health. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

5,600 species of vascular plants, 600 species of birds and 190 species of mammals. 
26 species of mammals and 14 species of birds found in Bhutan feature in the 
World Conservation Union’s Red List of Threatened Species59. 

Air environment – Air environment to a large 
extent is still unpolluted. Currently, monitoring 
of air quality is limited to suspended particulate 
matter (PM10), while SOx and NOx are monitored 
periodically. The air quality monitoring stations 
have been established in Gomtu, Pasakha, Bajo, 
Kanglung, Kurichhu and Thimphu and data from 
these stations are broadcast on Bhutan Broadcasting 
Service Television (BBS TV) and websites of BBSC, 
Kuensel and NEC for dissemination of information. Thimphu recorded suspended 
particulate matter (SPM) of 45.80µg/m3 on 17/6/201360. Pasakha, Gomtu and 
Phuntsholing recorded significantly higher PM 10 concentration than Thimphu. 
PM 10 concentration in most other places will be lower than Thimphu because of 
smaller population, fewer vehicles and less industrial activities. 

Water environment - Bhutan’s water resources are mainly in the form of rivers. There 
are four major river basins, viz. Amochhu (Toorsa), Wangchhu (Raidak), Punatsangchhu 
(Sunkosh) and Drangmechhu (Manas). The three smaller river basins include 
Meramachhu, Jomotshangkhachhu and Sherichhu. All rivers originate within the 
country except Amochhu, Gongri and Kurichhu all of which originate in the southern 
part of the Tibetan Plateau61.

The National Environment Commission conducts water quality surveys and monitoring 
along major rivers and tributaries at least twice annually; pre- and post-monsoon. 
The data collected through the survey indicate that the main rivers and their major 
tributaries, with a few exceptions, are still unpolluted. The natural water quality can 
be characterized as highly oxygenated, slightly alkaline with low conductivity and no 
recorded salinities. However, there are localized water pollution problems due to 
frequent unsanitary conditions along banks of streams and rivers (see box below). 

Water Quality of Wangchhu, Thimphu.
The water quality assessment of Wangchhu which falls within the limits of the City 
periphery was conducted during the period March 5-9, 2012. The river was investigated 
at three different stretches for water quality assessment viz. Cheri, Babesa, and 
Khasadrapchhu, considering physical, chemical, microbiological and biological 
characteristics of the river. Results revealed Wangchhu at Babesa highly contaminated, 
that measured 428 CFU/100 ml faecal coliforms, whereas at Khasadrapchu it showed 
indication of recovery measuring 46CFU/100 ml water. Maximum permissible standard 
limit of faecal coliforms as recommended for Bhutan at final effluent from a sewerage 
treatment plant (STP) is 1,000 MPN/100 ml water. At Cheri, the river was free from 
faecal coliforms. 
A team also applied a bio-monitoring tool in the water quality assessment, which 
includes rapid field assessment of the quality of river considering bottom dwelling 
larvae of insects which are considered highly sensitive to the increase in pollution. 
Results revealed no pollution (water quality class I) in Cheri, critical to heavy pollution 
(III/IV) in Babesa, and critical to moderate pollution (III/II) in Khasadrapchhu.

This problem is exacerbated in the urban centers where surface drainage, grey 
water sullage from domestic households and uncontrolled seepage or overflow 
from septic tanks and pipes enter into the watercourses.

5.17.2 Key Challenges

Environmental conservation is becoming increasingly challenging as we open up 
to meet the development needs of a growing population. The key environmental 
challenges that the country faces relate to the nexus of environmental degradation, 
poverty and economic growth. Population growth, increasing demand of natural 
resources, inappropriate technology and consumption choices, and pressures of 
development are the drivers of environmental degradation. 

The ambient air and water quality, in general, still ranges from good to excellent but 
there are some pockets of urban and industrial areas where air and water quality is 
deteriorating due to vehicular and industrial pollution, construction activities, and 
unsanitary waste disposal. It is also increasingly evident that poor environmental 
quality has adversely affected human health. The environmental problems such as 
lack of access to adequate clean water, clean air and energy are closely linked to 
poverty. Interventions such as reducing indoor air pollution, protecting sources 
of safe drinking water, protecting soil from contamination, improved sanitation 
measures, and better public health governance, offer tremendous opportunities 
for reducing the incidence of a number of critical health problems. 

Although the Government has enacted Waste Prevention and Management Act in 
2009 yet there are challenges in terms of proper waste management. While there 
are some good practices being carried out on a pilot basis, lack of proper waste 
management, indiscriminate littering, open dumping of solid waste are some of 
the challenges faced which eventually pollutes natural environment posing serious 
hazards to public health. While the waste regulation is being revised, education, 
awareness and advocacy programmes are very critical for proper waste management. 

With the ever increasing development activities and industries, a challenge to 
the environment and planning sector is the cumulative effect of the combined 
activities on the ecosystem within a given space. The challenge of the task lies in 
the lack of capacity within the National Environment Commission to undertake 
such a huge activity. 

Another major set of challenges arises from emerging global environmental 
concerns such as climate change, global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, 
and biodiversity loss. The key is to operationalize the principle of common but 
differentiated responsibility of countries in relation to these problems. At the 
same time, multilateral regimes and programmes responding to these global 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

environmental issues must not adversely impact the development opportunities 
of developing countries. 

The major challenge faced by the sector in implementation of the legislation 
pertains to lack of human resources and capacity. 

Water Security - Water is an important natural resource for basic survival of all 
living beings. It is also a vital resource for our agriculture, hydropower projects and 
industries. Bhutan has one of the world’s highest per capita availability of water with 
long-term mean annual flow estimated at 73,000 million m3 per annum and the per 
capita water availability estimated at 100,000 m3. On the demand side, the gross 
consumptive demand is estimated to increase from 422 million m3 in 2002 to 541 
million m3 in 2022. Non-consumptive demand, in the form of hydropower demand, 
is estimated to increase from 6,700 million m3 in 2002 to 26,900 million m3 in 202262.

While at macro level the per capita water availability is high, at local levels access 
to water is a serious concern with several places facing water shortages. Only 78 
percent of the population has access to safe drinking water and about 12.5 percent 
of arable land is irrigated63. 

The 2002 water supply adequacy analysis carried out in 28 urban towns, as part 
of Water Resource Management Plan preparation, revealed that 11 towns faced 
water shortages and another seven more towns would face water constraints by 
201364. Till recently, surface water was the main source for drinking water but 
some towns like Thimphu, Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar have now resorted to 
exploring ground water due to acute water shortages. 

Similarly, despite abundance of water resources at macro level, arable land is largely 
dependent on rains. In the absence of rain, farmers are forced to leave their land 
fallow and this has direct impact on poverty and national food and nutrition security 
goals. Many irrigation channels constructed in the past remains unutilized due to 
lack of water. In the Tenth Plan, to enhance paddy production extensive network 
of new irrigation schemes were constructed in targeted Dzongkhags but without 
adequate and reliable water source these schemes may not benefit the farmers. 

Further, hydropower sector is the major contributor to the national revenue. However, 
the level of revenue it contributes depends on hydrological factors. In 2011, electricity 
sector experienced negative growth mainly due to hydrological risk. Hydropower not 
only contributes to export earnings but it is also one of the main reasons for enhancing 
competitiveness of many of our industries due to cheap electricity. 

Recognizing the importance of water, the government enacted Water Act in 
2011 and formulated of Water Vision 2025 and Water Policy. However, issues of 
coordination among different stakeholders; water rights issues; water conservation, 
management and utilization; etc remain a challenge. 

Human-wildlife conflict - The success of environment conservation has created 
a new challenge of human-wildlife conflict affecting all 20 Dzongkhags. In some 
of the Dzongkhags farmers have stopped cultivating due to the loss of crops to 
wildlife. It is estimated that annual crop loss ranges from 0.3 to 18 percent of the 
total household income. To achieve food security, addressing this issue will be 
essential.

5.17.4 Strategies

The key strategies include:

• Implementation of the National Strategy and Action Plan for Low Carbon 
Development 2012. 
• Mainstreaming of environment across all sectoral and local government 
programmes and projects. In this context, the Eleventh Plan SKRAs are 
formulated based on the four pillars of GNH and this requires all sectors/
local governments to address environmental issues. A mainstreaming 
framework has been developed to guide sectors and local governments in 
the integration of cross cutting issues in plans, programmes and activities.

• Water security will be strengthened through the development of integrated 
water resource management plan and better coordination. This will be 
further supported through the enforcement of Water Act and development 
of water regulation. 
• Environmental assessment process will be strengthened through 
establishment of four regional environment offices which also aims to deliver 
prompt, professional and effective public services. This will be supported 
with the development of online environmental clearance system.
• Conducting strategic environmental assessment for hydropower projects 
and transmission lines and carrying capacity of the mines and industries to 
ensure sustainable development and inter-generational equity.
• Sustainable production and utilization of timber and non-timber forest 
based products will be pursued through sustainable forestry management 
practices. 
• To address the issue of human-wildlife conflict, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forest will construct solar-powered electric fence, provide electric 
fence energizer and will continue with Gewog level insurance programs for 
livestock and crops from endowment funds. The Ministry will also carry out 
a study to understand ecology and behavioral aspects of the main conflict 
species and develop a strategy to address the issue on a permanent basis.

 5.18 Good Governance

The fourth pillar of GNH is Good Governance as it provides an enabling environment 
that is vital for sustainable and equitable socio-economic development. Bhutan has 
made good progress in strengthening governance through promotion of transparency, 
efficiency and accountability in the political and administrative processes. 

The Eleventh Plan will continue to place emphasis on further strengthening 
governance by strengthening democracy, improving public service delivery, 
promoting gender equality, curbing corruption and enhancing safety. 

5.18.1 Current Situation

Democracy and Decentralization – The second Parliamentary elections was held 
on 13 July 2013 and the Peoples Democratic Party was elected to form the second 
government for a term of five years. 

Further, the Parliament passed the Local Government Act 2009, which translated 
the important constitutional principle of decentralized governance into law and 
mandated the formation of local governments for the development, management 
and administration of areas under their jurisdiction. Accordingly, the first local 
government elections were held in 2011 and the next local government elections 
are scheduled to be held in 2016. 

Also, the government has initiated number of proactive measures to further 
strengthen the process of decentralization, including the introduction of Gewog 
Based Planning process in the Ninth Plan and the rationalized formula based 
annual grants system for all local government from the Tenth Plan. The formula 
for local government annual grants was reviewed and revised64 and the Eleventh 
Plan resource envelop to the local governments are based on the revised resource 
allocation formula. 

Public Service Management – To promote meritocracy, enhance efficiency, 
transparency, professionalism and accountability in the civil service, number of 
civil service reforms have been implemented such as the Position Classification 
System in 2006, the Civil Service Act 2010 and the revised Civil Service Rules 
and Regulations 2012. Currently, there are 24,275 civil servants providing public 
services delivery. 

05

CENTRAL PLAN

64Revised resource allocation formula includes multi-dimensional poverty index, transport cost 
index, population and geographical area.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

In addition, to strengthen performance of government agencies, the Government 
Performance Management System (GPMS) has been developed, Agencification 
Guidelines framed and 136 most commonly availed Government to Citizen Services 
- G2C services such as birth and death registration, trade licenses, timber permit 
etc – simplified and automated. 

Gender equality - The Constitution guarantees equality for all its citizens including 
women. Furthermore, it contains special provisions to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination and exploitation65 against women including trafficking, prostitution, 
abuse, violence, harassment, intimidation, degrading treatment and economic 
exploitation. In the area of inheritance, traditional customs favour women who 
have greater access to land and ownership. 

Although female literacy rate has improved from less than 40 percent in 2010 to 55 
percent68 in 2012, it remains low compared to the male literacy rate of 72 percent. 
The national Gender Parity Index (GPI) is reported at 1.0267. This indicates that on 
the whole, the correct proportions of females in relation to males are enrolled in 
the education system and there is no gender inequality in the Bhutanese education 
system. 

Female civil servants account for 32 percent68 of the total civil servants. In absolute 
terms, the number of female civil servants increased from 2,180 in 1996 to 7,926 
in 2012.

Curbing corruption – In an effort to curb corruption, the Anti-Corruption Act 2011 
– ACA 2011 (repealing ACA 2006) was enacted, various new rules and regulations 
such as such Gift Rules 2009, The Debarment (of Corrupt Firms) Rules 2008 and 
Asset Declaration Rule 2012 have been put in place and the National Anti Corruption 
Strategy launched. Transparency International’s 2012 Corruption Perception Index 
ranked Bhutan 33rd among the 176 nations, an improvement of five positions from 
38th in 2011. Similarly, the ACC’s 2012-13 annual report indicates that corruption is 
still a major challenge although people’s perception of the prevalence of corruption 
is declining. In 2012-2013, ACC received 449 complaints compared to 458 cases in 
the previous year.

5.18.2 Key Challenges

Democracy and Decentralization - Democracy was introduced in Bhutan in 2008, 
and a democratic culture has yet to find firm footing. The Democracy Index produced 
by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Bhutan 104 out of 167 countries in 2011. 
One area Bhutan scores low is the political participation. The concern with this is 
if the citizens stop participating in the political process, for example not voting, 
then that system loses legitimacy since it is hard for it to claim that it has a political 
mandate of the majority of the people. Therefore, education and awareness and 
enhancing participation particularly of youth, women and disadvantaged groups 
are vital. 

To strengthen the process of decentralization, administrative and fiscal devolution 
of authority alone is not sufficient but of equal importance is to build the capacity 
of those at the grassroots to plan, implement and monitor development activities. 
Human resource strengthening at local levels both in terms of numbers and 
technical skills will be critical. At the same time, efforts will be made to deepen 
fiscal decentralization such as selected revenue sharing so as to create incentives 
for local governments to promote more commercial activities.

Public Service Management – While a number of initiatives has been implemented 
in the past to improve public service management, efficiency, performance and 
public service delivery remains a challenge. The rapid growth of civil service, 
which averaged 4 percent per annum during the last five years, and high costs, 
amounting to about 45 percent of the total recurrent expenditures, is a concern. 
The turn-around time for many of the public services to its citizens, businesses 
and intra government services remain high and inefficient. Enhancing government 
performance and reducing the turn-around time for public service delivery (G2C, 
G2B and G2G) will be key priorities.

Gender – Female participation in elected offices, ratio of female to male in tertiary 
education, female youth unemployment and gender sensitive policies and working 
environment are some of the challenges in ensuring gender equality. 

Corruption – While the ACC’s 2012-13 annual report indicates that people’s 
perception of the prevalence of corruption is declining it is still a challenge. The 
major areas of concerns are the misuse of authority, misuse of government 
property, embezzlement and nepotism.

PLANS

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

 6.1 Introduction

The bottom-up Gewog-based planning process, as per the decentralized planning 
framework, was introduced in the Ninth Plan. Since then, the local governments 
have been formulating their Five Year Plans based on the development priorities 
identified by the communities at the Gewog level. 

The introduction of the Gewog-based planning process was followed by “fiscal 
decentralization” in the Tenth Plan. The allocation of annual grants to local 
governments based on the resource allocation formula that took into account 
principles of equity, transparency and objectivity was launched. The new system 
of allocating resources to the local governments provided greater predictability 
and offered higher flexibility in prioritization and programming of activities. The 
devolution of authority has enhanced capacities of the local governments in 
planning, prioritization and fiscal management.

Further, to bring clarity on the roles of various levels of the government in the 
delivery of public services at the local level and to facilitate the distribution 
of resources between the centre and the local governments, the division of 
responsibilities framework was developed in 2012. The division of responsibilities 
framework70, clearly delineates responsibilities among the central agencies, Class 
“A” Thromde, Dzongkhags and Gewogs guided by the ‘principle of subsidiarity’. 
The ‘principle of subsidiarity’ is that provision of public goods and services should 
take place at the lowest level of the government and that the centre should be 
involved only when the lower levels of the government cannot provide the goods 
and services efficiently. The division of responsibility framework will be reviewed 
during the Eleventh Plan mainly to assess the capacity of the local governments to 
shoulder increased responsibilities and to build their capacities accordingly.

In addition to the broad based socio-economic development activities, targeted poverty 
intervention programmes such as the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) 
and the National Rehabilitation Programme (NRP) were initiated in the Tenth Plan to 
accelerate poverty reduction and address disparities at the local level. Accordingly, 13 
poorest villages71 were supported through REAP I and around 109 villages have been 
identified for implementation under REAP II in the Eleventh Plan.

Under the NRP, 44 households in Khenadrang, Pemagatshel were rehabilitated. 
While the rehabilitation at Nye, Lhuentshe (55 households); Bebji, Haa (83 
households); Borangmo, Pemagatshel (51 households) and Dawathang, Samdrup 
Jongkhar (31 households) are ongoing, the planning and feasibility study for 
Tanzama, Pemagatshel and Serzhong, Tsirang respectively have been initiated 
under the programme. Efforts are also underway to identify other communities 
for rehabilitation given that this programme benefits not only the beneficiary 
communities but also the government through avoidance of the higher costs 
associated with provision of pubic goods and services for reaching the unreached.

6.1.1 Planning Process

The local government plans were formulated based on the Local Government Act 
2009, the Eleventh Plan preparation guidelines, the Local Development Planning 
Manual, the Thromde Structural Plans, the Local Area Plans (LAPs) and the 
indicative five year resource envelope. The process involved close consultations 
with the communities in order to take stock of the ground realities and assess their 
needs and aspirations. These were further deliberated and discussed at the Gewog 
Tshogdes, Dzongkhag Tshogdus, and Thromde Tshogdus before being finalized and 
approved. The draft LG Eleventh Plan was then submitted to the GNHC for further 
discussion and coordination at the national level.

While sectoral activities at the local level, as per the division of responsibility 
framework, are prioritized and planned by the local governments, the planning for 
education activities is centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Education. This is 
done given the strategic importance of the education sector for the future of our 
nation and to ensure that all children across the nation have equal access to quality, 
adequate, efficient and cost effective education services. The implementation 
is done by the local governments with resources provided by the Ministry of 
Education.

The major changes in the formula in the Eleventh Plan are that allocation for 
population has been reduced from 70 percent to 35 percent, area has been 
increased from 5 percent to 10 percent, poverty criteria has been replaced by 
multidimensional poverty index with a weight of 45 percent and a new criteria 
on transport cost index with a weight of 10 percent has been included to account 
for high cost of investments in interior and remote Dzongkhags/Gewogs that face 
higher transportation costs. 

The formula based resource allocation does not apply to class “A” Thromdes. The 
resource allocation to class “A” Thromde are need based due to the diversity and 
complexity of these Thromdes in terms of social, economic and environmental 
issues. Further, while some Thromdes are ready with their structural plans and the 
local area plans, which form the basis for infrastructure planning and investments, 
others are still in the process of preparation. 

6.1.3 Capital Allocation 

From the total capital budget of Nu. 92 billion, Nu. 25 billion (about 27 percent of 
the total) is allocated to Local Governments as follows:

• Formula based annual grants to the Dzongkhags and Gewogs - Nu. 15 billion
o Of which to Dzongkhag – Nu. 9 billion (60 percent)
o Of which to Gewogs – Nu. 6 billion (40 percent)



• Local Government Empowerment Programme 
(Dzongkhags and Gewogs )- Nu. 5 billion
• Capital grants to class “A” Thromdes (Thimphu, Phuentsholing, 
Gelephu and Samdrup Jongkhar) - Nu. 5 billion

(Dzongkhags and Gewogs) in the Eleventh Plan is an increase of 25 percent over 
the Tenth Plan allocation of Nu. 12 billion while capital grants to the four class “A” 
Thromdes is also significantly higher compared to the Tenth Plan allocation. Based 
on the formula, the following is the allocation to Dzongkhags and Gewogs:

An allocation of Nu. 5 billion is earmarked for municipal infrastructure and services 
for the four class “A” Thromdes. 

The Local Government Empowerment Programme for which Nu 5 billion has been 
allocated is towards common facilities such as utility vehicles, power tillers, etc 
and includes Nu. 2 million for each Gewog every year. 

In addition to the Nu. 25 billion directly earmarked as capital allocation to the 
Local Governments, a provision of Nu. 4.5 billion has been kept under Ministry

of Education for Dzongkhag Education Services which will be implemented for 
the benefit of the local communities. The allocation under the targeted poverty 
intervention programmes is also over and above the local government allocation. 
Moreover, many centrally executed plans and programmes ultimately benefit the 
local governments and communities, though the resources are reflected under the 
sector concerned.

On the basis of the standard of living, health and education outcomes, Bumthang 
Dzongkhag is above national average. 

The poverty and unemployment rates are lower than the national average. The 
mean annual household income is Nu. 168,715 mainly from agriculture, livestock, 
non-wood forest products, weaving and tourism.

The general literacy level is about 67.6 percent. The adjusted net primary 
attendance rate is 98 percent, indicating that 2 percent of children aged 6 to 12 
are not enrolled in school. 

The Dzongkhag falls a day short in terms of meeting the sufficiency levels for 
number of mean healthy days in a month as per GNH 2010 Index. The BLSS 2012 
also indicate a high number of crude death rates and lower crude birth rates on 
average indicating a declining population trend.

The 2010 GNH Index reports Bumthang to be in medium happiness category with 
a value of 0.736. 

6.2.1.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

Bumthang Dzongkhag is one of the most richly endowed districts in terms of 
historical and spiritual legacy. Some of the oldest and most venerated temples 
are found in Bumthang, including Jambay and Kurjey Lhakhang. Besides, there 
are numerous other temples and shrines, and many of them are linked to Guru 
Rinpoche’s visit in 746 A.D. Further, two-thirds of the Dzongkhag (Chhoekhor 
and Tang Gewogs) in the northern part falls within the boundary of Wangchuck 
Centennial Park, buffered by pockets of biological corridors while southern 
Bumthang (Chumey, lower Tang and Ura Gewogs) is part of another protected 
area, Thrumshingla National Park, making the region home to rare and endangered 
flora and fauna. Bumthang is also rich in agricultural produce such as buckwheat, 
honey, apples, potato, rice, dairy products, etc. Bumthang is also well known 
for the art of weaving the specialized yathra sheep wool textiles which is highly 
marketable both within and outside the country. 

Some of the economic opportunities of the Dzongkhag are development of new 
cultural and ecotourism products and services, and development of cottage, small 
and medium industries of historical, religious and cultural potential which will 
contribute towards enhancing household income and employment generation. 

Bumthang is already a very popular tourist destination but the number of nights 
tourists spend at present is limited due to long travel time taken by road. With the 
establishment of domestic air services in Bumthang, the Dzongkhag can benefit if 
the number of days usually spent on the road travelling could be converted into 
bed nights in Bumthang. The Dzongkhag could explore new tourism products to 
encourage tourists to spend more time. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The potential in agriculture and livestock production and the specialized art of 
weaving yathra could be explored and developed into thriving cottage, small and 
medium industries. 

With better health and education status currently, the Dzongkhag can further build 
on thier success and improve these outcomes by strengthening health and education 
services. 

Some of the major challenges faced include loss of crop to wildlife, very cold winter 
and snow falls, lack of storage and marketing facilities particularly for agricultural 
products and disparities at local levels.

6.2.1.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies of the Dzongkhag will be i) tourism 
development and development of cottage, small and medium industries, and ii) 
targeted poverty reduction programmes.

Tourism development will be pursued in close collaboration with the Tourism 
Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses. The Dzongkhag will focus 
on development of new products unique to the Dzongkhag so that tourists are 
encouraged to spend more days in Bumthang. The products will include eco-tourism, 
trekking, farm/home stays, historical and cultural excursions. The Dzongkhag will 
facilitate development of necessary tourism infrastructure and services including 
training of local communities/entrepreneurs in tourism hospitality and services. 

The Dzongkhag also has potential for agro-processing industries based on products 
such as buckwheat, honey, apples, potato, rice, medicinal plants, mushrooms and 
dairy products. The Dzongkhag in coordination with the relevant central agencies 
will address issues of human-wildlife conflict, agricultural storage, packaging and 
marketing facilities, and facilitate establishment of farmers’ groups/cooperatives 
to increase production scale and management. The other potential area for 
development of organized cottage and small industries is the cultural industries 
based on textiles. Bumthang is famous for sheep wool textile such as “yathra”. The 
Dzongkhag in collaboration with the Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Craft will 
facilitate product development, quality assurance, establishment of cooperatives, 
raw material bank and export promotion of these products. The Dzongkhag will 
work towards creating an enabling environment for development of cottage

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

and small industries by addressing issues of access to credit, land, storage and 
marketing facilities, raw material etc in close coordination with the relevant central 
agency/institutions.

Towards reaching the unreached and the disadvantaged, the Targeted Poverty 
Intervention Programme will be implemented. Under the programme, six poor 
villages namely Trashiling, Zhurey, Lusibi, Chutoe, Tandingang and Shingneer will be 
supported under REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, 
capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be 
some of the interventions at village level in addition to specific interventions at 
household levels. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the 
centre. 

Others issues such as disaster management, solid waste management and public 
service delivery will also receive priority.

the south-western part of the country and shares its borders with the Dzongkhags 
of Dagana to the east, Samtse and Haa to the west, Paro and Thimphu to the north 
and the Indian states of West Bengal to the south. 

It has 11 Gewogs namely Bjachhog, Bongo, Chapcha, Darla, Dungna, Geling, 
Getena, Logchina, Metakha, Phuntsholing and Sampheling, and a Drungkhag and 
a Thromde in Phuentsholing.

The current situation of the Dzongkhag is assessed based on the standard of living, 
health and education outcomes which make up the multidimensional poverty index. 

The high level of mean annual household income and low unemployment rates 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

have contributed to relatively low levels of income poverty. The majority of the rural 
population depends on agriculture, livestock and horticulture for their livelihood. The 
main agricultural products include mandarin, cardamom, potatoes and a variety of 
vegetables. Livestock rearing is another major occupation and provides opportunities 
in dairy and poultry products because of the availability of ready markets.

The general literacy rate is high at 70.5 percent compared to the national average of 
63 percent. However, the percentage of children aged 6 to 12 enrolled in school is 
low at 89 percent, indicating that about 11 percent of the children are not enrolled 
in school. This could be due to remoteness of some of the settlements. 

The Dzongkhag meets the sufficiency levels for number of mean healthy days in 
a month as per GNH 2010 Index. The BLSS 2012 also indicate a higher number of 
crude death rates and lower crude birth rates on average indicating a declining 
population trend.

The 2010 GNH Index reports Chukha to be in medium happiness category with a 
value of 0.752. 

6.2.2.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Chukha Dzongkhag offers lot a of economic opportunities. It is the commercial 
and industrial hub of the nation with adequate access and facilities such as roads, 
telecommunications and electricity. The two largest hydropower plants, 336 
MW Chukha hydroelectricity plant and 1020 MW Tala hydroelectricity plant, and 
some of the large mineral, metal and wood based industries are located in the 
Dzongkhag. The Dzongkhag also has potential for enhancing cash crop, non-wood 
forest products and floriculture production if issues of human wildlife conflict, farm 
labour shortages, irrigation and storage and marketing facilities are addressed. 

Further, the establishment of a mini dry-port in Phuentsholing, construction of 
Raidak-Lamoizingkha and Manitar-Raidak roads, an international standard football 
ground and three new mega hydroelectricity projects viz. 180 MW Bunakha 
Hydroelectric project, 540 MW Ammochhu Hydroelectric project, and 570 MW 
Wangchu Hydroelectric project are planned for implementation in the Eleventh 
Plan. These activities provide opportunities for employment generation and 
further boosting of trade and commerce in the Dzongkhag. 

In terms of the challenges, while the overall poverty rates are just below the 
national average, there are villages within the Dzongkhag where poverty is high 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

and people lack the basic socio-economic facilities due to remoteness and difficult 
terrain. Addressing these pockets of rural poverty will be a challenge. In the Tenth 
Plan, Mandokha and Choleykha villages were among the ten poorest villages 
supported under the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) I.

6.2.2.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies of the Dzongkhag will be on i) 
enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity, and ii) targeted poverty reduction 
programmes.

The majority of the rural population in the Dzongkhag depends on agriculture, 
livestock and horticulture for their livelihood. Therefore, the Dzongkhag will focus 
on enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity which will not only contribute 
towards enhancing household incomes and employment generation but will also 
contribute towards import substitution of agricultural and livestock products. 
The Dzongkhag has potential to enhance agricultural production of mandarin, 
cardamom, potatoes and a variety of vegetables, besides possessing a rich reserve 
of non-wood forest resources such as medicinal plants, edible wild vegetable 
and roots. Hence efforts will focus on development of rural infrastructure, 
commercialization, farm mechanization, better herd management and use of 
improved breeds of cattle, addressing human wildlife conflict and development of 
small and medium enterprises through formation of famers’ groups/cooperatives.

Towards reaching the unreached and the disadvantaged, the Targeted Poverty 
Intervention Programme will be implemented. Under the programme, five villages 
namely Dolepchen, Laleykha, Pana C, Pangsila and Zamsar will be supported 
through REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of 
the interventions at village level, in addition to specific interventions at household 
levels.The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the centre.

Dagana Dzongkhag is one of the poorer Dzongkhags with high levels of poverty 
incidence, unemployment and low general literacy. The 2010 GNH Index reports 
Dagana to be in high happiness category with a value of 0.783. Access to the 
Dzongkhag is through the Dagana-Tsirang highway which is often closed during 
the monsoons cutting-off the Dzongkhag from the rest of the country. 

Agriculture farming is the main source of income for majority of the population. 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The fertile land and suitable climatic conditions make Dagana one of the major 
producers of mandarin and cardamom in the country. Other crops and vegetables 
like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, potato, chillies, tomatoes and horticulture crops 
like banana, passion fruit, pear and avocado are also grown.

The Dzongkhag also has potential for harvesting Non-Wood Forest Products 
(NWFP) such as Pipla, Thysolinia and Cinnamon. However, the NWFP potential is 
underutilized thereby not contributing to income of the households. 

Currently, a 126 MW Dagachhu Hydroelectricity project is under construction in 
the Dzongkhag which is expected to be commissioned by early 2014. 

6.2.3.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Favorable climatic conditions and fertile land provides the opportunity for the 
Dzongkhag to enhance agricultural (paddy, vegetables, fruits etc), livestock (dairy 
and meat products) and NWFP (Pipla, Thysolinia and Cinnamon) production. 

Dagana also has potential for tourism development. Dagana - Lamoizingkha could 
be developed as a beautiful 3 days trek for bird watchers and could be even 
extended for the fourth day to Tala from Lamoizingkha. Another ancient footpath 
route starting from Genekha (Thimphu) via some beautiful lakes to Dagana could 
be developed into an 8-days trek. Besides, there are cultural attractions in Tseza 
and Kana Gewogs. Bird watching and orchid tours along the road are tourist’s 
attractions in Gesarling and Trashiding Gewogs. Wachey cave is also an interesting 
sight for tourists. 

Further, with the completion of 126 MW Dagachhu Hydroelectricity project in early 
2014 the reliability of electricity supply in the Dzongkhag will be enhanced creating 
opportunities for establishing small and medium industries in the Dzongkhag. In 
addition, the construction of a 2,560 MW Sankosh Hydroelectricity project during 
the Eleventh Plan will provide favorable environment for boosting local trade and 
commerce and enhancing employment and income generating activities. 

The major challenge faced by the Dzongkhag is the high levels of poverty. Among 
the 20 Dzongkhags, Dagana has the third highest level of poverty, almost double 
that of the national average of 12 percent in 2012. The high levels of poverty is 
attributed to remoteness of the Dzongkhag and poor agricultural productivity due 
to human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages and lack of adequate irrigation, 
storage and marketing facilities. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

6.2.3.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on are i) 
enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity, ii) tourism development and iii) 
targeted poverty reduction programmes.

With the majority of the population depending on agricultural products such 
as paddy, vegetables and fruits; livestock mainly dairy and meat products; and 
non-wood forest products like pipla, thysolinia and cinnamon; for their livelihood 
and income generation, the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agriculture, 
livestock and non-wood forest production. Support in the form of land terracing, 
rehabilitation and plantation of citrus and cardamom, supply of high quality disease 
resistant seeds and seedlings, supply of labour saving farm machinery, irrigation 
and capacity development such as group formation, awareness, advanced training 
on farming and marketing skills will be provided. Measures to address human 
wildlife conflict will be pursued aggressively. Further, with adequate and reliable 
electricity available from early 2014, the Dzongkhag will explore possibilities of 
establishing small and medium agro-processing industries in the Dzongkhag. 

To supplement farm income, the Dzongkhag will promote tourism development. 
The Dzongkhag in close cooperation with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local 
communities and businesses will explore development of new tourism products 
such as trekking, bird watching, orchid tours, bicycle tours, water sports and 
farm/home stays in the Dzongkhag. With the communities the Dzongkhag will 
facilitate development of tourism infrastructure and services including training of 
communities in tourism hospitality and services. 

To address the high levels of poverty in the Dzongkhag, the targeted poverty 
reduction programme will be implemented in collaboration with the relevant 
central agency. Under the programme, seven villages namely Balukop, Bartsa, 
Devitar, Banglachu, Sanu Dorona, Tachay and Tshalabji will be supported through 
the REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some 
of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels 
will be provided to the poorest households within the village. The funds for this 
programme will be directly provided from the centre.

6.2.4 Gasa Dzongkhag

Gasa Dzongkhag is situated in the extreme northwest of the country bordering the 
Autonomous Region of Tibet in the north and Thimphu, Punakha and Wangdue 
Phodrang Dzongkhags in the south. 

The Dzongkhag comprises four Gewogs namely Khatoed, Khamoed, Laya and 
Lunana. It is located at an altitude ranging from 1500-4500 meters above sea level. 
The climatic condition ranges from temperate to alpine with cold winters and 
pleasant short summers.

Gasa Dzongkhag has the lowest levels of income poverty with annual household 
income of Nu. 364,797 (BLSS 2012). The annual household income is highest 
amongst all Dzongkhags. Wages contribute about 15 percent of the total income, 
agriculture 22 percent and non-agriculture 63 percent. Non-agriculture income is 
generated mainly from collection and sale of cordyceps. 

While in terms of income Gasa has the lowest levels of poverty, the poverty 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

measured on multidimensional basis (health, education and living standards) is 
the highest in the country at 46.6 percent (BMIS 2010). This is mainly because the 
delivery of health and education services is a challenge due to difficult terrain, 
harsh climatic conditions and remoteness. Addressing health and education issues 
remain a priority.

The 2010 GNH Index reports Gasa to be in high happiness category with a value of 
0.771. 

6.2.4.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The key opportunities are in the area of livestock and NWFP production. Gasa 
Dzongkhag produced about 20 MT of butter, 37 MT of cheese and 23 MT of chugo 
in 2011 (RNR Statistics, MoA, 2012). The Dzongkhag recorded highest collection 
of cordyceps in 2010 with 26 percent (141.7 kgs) of the total 541.9 Kgs collected 
(DAMC, MoA, 2010).

In addition, the Dzongkhag falls under the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Park and 
is the habitat for different species of birds and animals like the takin, musk deer, blue 
sheep, snow leopard, red panda, raven, wild pheasants, snow pigeons, red billed 
cough, Himalayan black bear, tiger, etc. The Dzongkhag is famous for hot springs 
and number of “Menchus” (medicinal springs) with renowned medicinal properties 
providing health, mind and recreational benefits. Therefore, it provides an excellent 
opportunity for drawing numerous domestic as well as foreign tourists. The number 
of foreign tourists visiting the Dzongkhag is increasing where it recorded 409 visitors 
in 2011 (NSB, 2012). 

The lack of access to health and education facilities and services is a major 
challenge faced by the Dzongkhag. The difficult terrain, harsh climatic conditions 
and remoteness makes it difficult to provide these facilities. Some of the problems 
are lack of private service providers and contractors, less time for development and 
transportation due to snowfall in winter in the northern regions of the Dzongkhag. 
The general literacy rate according to BLSS 2012 was 49.4 compared to the national 
average of 63. The primary school completion rate is also lowest in the country 
with only 41.3 percent (89)74 of children completing primary education. Access to 
education is provided by four schools. 

BLSS 2012 also reports that Gasa had low child survival rate of 85 percent 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS

74National primary school completion rate



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

compared to 94.1 percent at national level. Crude death rate which shows the 
number of deaths per year per thousand people was reported to be 28.2 which is 
significantly higher than the national average of 8.5 (BLSS, 2012). There is also an 
increasing problem of lifestyle diseases, stress, drug and alcohol abuse and lack of 
mental health care. The Dzongkhag doesn’t have a hospital and health services are 
provided by two BHUs and two ORCs. 

The development of infrastructure facilities is a challenge. The Dzongkhag was 
recently connected with motorable road. Although 96.9 percent of the 688 
households have access to electricity, only 35.7 percent have access to grid 
electricity supply. 

6.2.4.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on are i) 
improving health and education outcomes, ii) tourism development, iii) livestock 
production and commercialization and sustainable management of forestry 
products, and iv) targeted poverty reduction programmes

As highlighted above, while the Dzongkhag has the lowest levels of income poverty, 
it has the highest levels of multidimensional poverty. This is primarily due to poor 
health and education outcomes in the Dzongkhag. Therefore, one key strategy 
will be to improve health and education outcomes. The Dzongkhag in close 
cooperation with the Ministries of Health and Education and other relevant central 
agencies will ensure that necessary infrastructure facilities and other resources 
such as equipment, drugs and vaccines and adequate/qualified personnel are 
made available to improve delivery of health and education services. Where 
delivery of such services is difficult due to remoteness and challenging terrain, the 
Dzongkhag will make alternative arrangements to ensure that these communities 
are not deprived of the services guaranteed by the Constitution. 

The rich flora and fauna and number of “Menchus” and “Nyes” (religious sites) make 
Gasa an attractive destination for both foreign and local tourists. The Dzongkhag 
will liaise with Tourism Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses for 
the development of tourism in the Dzongkhag. The Dzongkhag will facilitate 
development of tourism infrastructure and services such as guesthouses, trekking 
path, home stays, community lodges and exotic tourism products. The Dzongkhag 
will also facilitate training and capacity development of communities in tourism 
hospitality and other related services. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

With livestock products being one of the main sources of livelihood, the Dzongkhag 
will focus on enhancing livestock productivity and commercialization. The 
Dzongkhag will facilitate establishment of commercial livestock farming, breed 
improvement, access to micro-credit and insurance schemes. Further, as majority 
of the households depend on non-wood forest products such as cordyceps and 
medicinal plants for income, which accounts for almost 60 percent of their total 
income. Therefore to ensure sustainable livelihood from non-wood forest products, 
the Dzongkhag will ensure sustainable management of forest and forestry 
products through implementation of activities such as community and private 
forestry establishment, afforestation and reforestation programme, watershed 
management and conservation. 

While Gasa enjoys the highest levels of household income compared to the rest 
of the Dzongkhags, there are villages within the Dzongkhag where poverty levels 
are high. Therefore, to address these disparities, five villages namely Amochhu, 
Remi, Wachey, Yesona and Zomena will be supported through REAP Phase II, one 
of the targeted poverty reduction programmes. Income generating sustainable 
livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/
cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional 
support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households within the 
village. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the centre. 

Further, to improve the living conditions, particularly that of the civil servants, the 
National Housing Development Corporation in cooperation with the Dzongkhag 
Administration will construct 24 housing units in the Eleventh Plan to address the 
lack of decent housing facilities in the Dzongkhag.

6.2.5 Haa Dzongkhag

Haa Dzongkhag is situated at an elevation ranging from 1000 to 5600 meters 
above sea level. It borders Autonomous Region of Tibet in the north-west and 
Dzongkhags of Thimphu, Paro and Samtse in the south and east. 

The Dzongkhag is administratively divided into six Gewogs namely Bji, Katsho, Eusu, 
Samar, Gakidling and Sangbaykha. The Dzongkhag is supported by one Dungkhag 
to cover the Gewogs of Gakidling and Sangbaykha.

Haa being located at a very high altitude, the cultivatable agricultural land forms 
only around 2 percent of the total area of the Dzongkhag. Most of the area 
comprises of dry land and pasture land. The people of Haa depend on livestock 
and trade for their livelihood. Livestock rearing constitute an important economic 
activity, with a majority of the northern Gewogs depending on livestock products 
such as butter, cheese and yak meat. As per the Bhutan RNR statistics 2012, the 
highest source of income was from livestock products, about 53 percent of the 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

total income. Other sources of income were from cereal and cash crops like wheat, 
buckwheat, barley, potato, apples and vegetables. 

Health services are provided by one BHU-I supported by 3 grade II BHUs. 98.1 
percent of households have access to clean & safe drinking water as compared 
to the national average of 96.1 percent. GNH 2010 Survey reports that people of 
Haa enjoyed mean healthy days of 28 days in a month. The Dzongkhag has good 
education coverage with one higher secondary schools, three lower secondary 
schools, three primary school and two community schools. Recently, a private 
higher secondary school was established. The literacy rate for Dzongkhag is 68.6 
percent which is higher than the national average of 63 percent. However, about 
8 percent of children aged 6-12 years are not enrolled in schools. 

While the poverty incidence for the Dzongkhag is reported to be low as compared 
to the national average of 12 percent in 2012, there are pocket of settlements 
where poverty is high. In the Tenth Plan, Thangdokha, Dramekha and Ngatsena 
under Gakeyling Gewog were among the villages supported under the targeted 
poverty intervention programmes of REAP I and the National Rehabilitation 
Programme (NRP).

The 2010 GNH Index reports Haa to be in high happiness category with a value of 
0.775. 

6.2.5.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Haa valley opened to foreign tourism in 2002. Since then tourism has been an 
important source of livelihood through community based tourism. The rare White 
Poppy (Meconopsis superba) which is endemic to Haa and cannot be found anywhere 
else in the world, the wooded hills for hiking and mountain biking, religious and 
cultural sites, yak and cattle shows and the annual Summer Festival organized jointly 
by Tourism Council of Bhutan and Dzongkhag are some of the main attractions 
providing opportunities for further development of tourism in the Dzongkhag. 
Further, the traditional agricultural lifestyle and architecture could also provide 
opportunities for enhancing community based tourism through development of 
home-stays tourist packages. 

The Dzongkhag also has potential to enhance agricultural and livestock production. 
Wheat is the main cereal crop grown in the Dzongkhag and other crops include 
barley and buckwheat. In the south cardamom and ginger constitutes the principal 
cash crops while in the north, potato is the main cash crop with apples and 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

vegetables cultivated on a moderate scale. 

However, agricultural and livestock productivity is challenged by human wildlife 
conflict, shortage of farm labour and lack of storage and marketing facilities.

6.2.5.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
tourism development, ii) agricultural and livestock production and iii) targeted 
poverty intervention programme.

To supplement farm income, the Dzongkhag will promote tourism development. 
The Dzongkhag in close cooperation with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local 
communities and businesses will explore development of new tourism products 
unique to Haa such as trekking, mountain biking, White Poppy (Meconopsis superba) 
tours, religious and cultural tours, and farm/home stays. The Dzongkhag will 
facilitate development of tourism infrastructure and services including training of 
communities in tourism hospitality and services. 

Given that the majority of people are dependent on agriculture and livestock for 
their livelihood, the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agricultural & livestock 
production. Support in the form of supply of high quality disease resistant seeds and 
seedlings, farm mechanization, capacity development through group formations, 
awareness, advanced training on farming and marketing skills will be facilitated. 
Measures to address human wildlife conflict will be pursued aggressively.

Under the targeted poverty reduction programme, five villages namely Fentena, 
Tima, Getangay, Youkha and Yaba will be supported through REAP Phase II. 
Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and 
establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions 
at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to the 
poorest households. The funds for this programme will be direclty provided from 
the centre.

Further, about 83 poor and disadvantaged households will be rehabilitated in 
Bebji under Sombaykha Gewog as part of the National Rehabilitation Programme. 
Besides transitional support, the main interventions include support for house 
construction, water and electricity supply and construction of an extended 
classroom.

Lhuentse Dzongkhag is situated in the northeast part of the country and it borders 
Autonomous Region of Tibet in the north, and Mongar in the east and Bumthang in 
the south- west. It is the ancestral home of our Monarchs. The Dzongkhag consists 
of eight Gewogs namely Gangzur, Jaray, Khoma, Kurtoe, Menbi, Metsho, Minjay 
and Tshenkhar.

The poverty incidence is one of the highest in the country at 31.9 percent (Poverty 
Analysis Report 2012). The limited economic opportunities, infrastructure facilities 
and remoteness have contributed to low levels of mean annual household income, 
which was half of the national average in 2012. 

The Dzongkhag’s health and education indicators are also relatively poor 
compared to other Dzongkhags. About 12 percent of children aged 6-12 years are 
not enrolled in schools, the general literacy rate are among the lowest, and on an 
average people are sick for 6 days in a month. 

These factors have contributed to low levels of GNH Index value of 0.698.

6.2.6.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Being the ancestral home of our monarchs, host of important religious sites and its 
reputation in Kishuthara textile weaving, there is potential to enhance economic 
development through agriculture and livestock productivity, tourism and cultural 
industries. 

Household incomes can be enhanced through agriculture and non wood forest 
products. The favorable climatic conditions provide opportunities to enhance 
production of paddy, maize and vegetables such as chilli, potato, cauliflower, garlic 
and cabbage. In terms of non wood forest products, there is potential for sustainable 
harvesting of Pa-tsha, Naka pani, black pepper, amla etc.

There are a number of historical and religious sites in Lhuentse which could be 
explored for development as potential tourism products, both for domestic and 
international tourists. Natural tourist attractions include historical and religious 
sites, trekking routes, picnic spots and camping sites. Besides, the rich art of 
“kishuthara” weaving, farm houses/home stays and the rich flora and fauna could 
be potential products.

The prospect of developing small scale agro processing/cultural product could be 
explored. 

Some of the challenges faced include:

• Lack of tourism infrastructure – Currently, the number of tourists visiting the 
Dzongkhag is very few mainly due to lack of proper accommodation and other 
facilities. The tourists either have to depend on the Dzongkhag Guest House 
for accommodation or have to drive all the way from Mongar. 
• With regard to agricultural productivity, the Dzongkhag has arable land of 
5876 Ha (MoAF 2012, Bhutan RNR Statistics) with the capacity to be food self-
sufficient. However, due to shortage of farm labor and human wildlife conflict, 
agricultural productivity has not been harnessed to its full potential. 


6.2.6.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
targeted poverty intervention programme, ii) enhancing agricultural production 
and iii) development of cottage and small industries.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Lhuentse has the highest levels of poverty incidence in the country. Therefore, 
one key strategy will be the implementation of targeted poverty intervention 
programme to accelerate poverty reduction in the Dzongkhag. Under REAP II, 
six villages namely Kemptsong, Lukchu, Laber, Ney, Tsango and Yumchey/Pam 
will be supported. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of 
the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels will be 
provided to the poorest households. The funds for this programme will be directly 
provided from the centre. 

Similarly, under the national rehabilitation programme, 55 poor and disadvantaged 
households are being rehabilitated in Nye, Lhuentse. Besides the provision 
of transitional support, other activities being implemented include farm road 
construction (4.7 km), house construction support, construction of an Extended 
Classroom, power supply and water supply. 

Considering the agricultural potential the Dzongkhag has in terms of production of 
paddy, maize and vegetables such as chilli, potato, cauliflower, garlic and cabbage, 
besides, the non wood forest products such as Pa-Tsha, Naka pani, black pepper 
and Amla, enhancing agricultural productivity will be another major strategy. 
Agricultural productivity will be enhanced by strengthening key infrastructure such 
as farm roads, irrigation channels, storage and marketing facilities, formation of 
cooperatives/farmers group, farm mechanization and addressing human wildlife 
conflict issues. 

The Dzongkhag Administration will also focus on development of cottage and 
small industries to enhance household incomes, to generate employment and to 
facilitate import substitution particularly of agricultural products. The Dzongkhag 
in consultation with relevant central agencies will facilitate development of cottage 
and small industries by facilitating an enabling environment for development of 
such industries. Addressing issues of access to finance, land, raw materials, storage 
and marketing services will be prioritized. The development of agro-processing, 
cultural industries based on the famous “Kishuthara” and tourism and hospitality 
services will be further strengthened. The Dzongkhag in consultation with the 
Tourism Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses will facilitate 
development of both foreign and local tourism in the Dzongkhag. The issue of 
accommodation will be addressed by encouraging local communities to develop 
community lodges, home stays and farm houses.

6.2.7 Mongar Dzongkhag 

Mongar Dzongkhag is 450 km east of the capital city, Thimphu. The lower and 
southern parts are sub-tropical while northern and higher regions have temperate 
climatic conditions. The Dzongkhag is bordered by Trashigang, Lhuentse, 
Pemagatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Zhemgang and Bumthang Dzongkhags. The 
Kurichhu, Sherichhu and Dangmechhu are important rivers in the Dzongkhag. 

There are 17 Gewogs namely Balam, Chali, Chaskhar, Dremitse, Drepong, Gongdu, 
Jurmey, Kengkhar, Mongar, Narang, Ngatshang, Saling, Sherimung, Silambi, 
Thangrong, Tsakaling and Tsamang, and a Dungkhag at Weringla to support the 
two most remote Gewogs - Gongdue and Silambi. 

The 60 MW Kurichhu Hydropower Plant located at Gyelposhing Mongar was

(REAP) I, targeted poverty intervention programmes were implemented in Pam 
and Chaibi under Gongdue Gewog to enhance rural income and living conditions 
of about 18 households with 270 people. 

While incomes have improved, multidimensional poverty is high at 33.2 percent 
against the national average of 25.8 percent in 2010. The mean household income 
and general literacy is lower than the national average while crude death rate is 
higher. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Mongar to be in medium happiness category with a 
value of 0.732

6.2.7.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

The electricity generated from 60 MW Kuri Chhu Hydro Power Plant, the completion of 
Gyelposhing-Nganglam highway in the Eleventh Plan, the construction of industrial estate 
at Bondeyma, close proximity to domestic airports at Bumthang and Yongphula and huge 
agricultural potential including fruits, maize, vegetables and potatoes provides excellent 
opportunity to develop the Dzongkhag as an agro-processing hub of the East. Further, 
the development of 2,640 MW Kuri-Gongri hydroelectricity project during the Eleventh 
Plan will boost economic and business opportunities and growth in the Dzongkhag.

The Dzongkhag being located in the sub-tropical region has huge potential for 
production of agricultural products like barley, maize, potatoes and fruits. In 2011, 
the Dzongkhag contributed to the production of 110 metric tons (25 percent of total 
production) of mango, 96 metric tons (17 percent of total production) of plum, 2,723 
metric tons of mandarin and 131 metric tons of peach in the country. The Dzongkhag 
also produced 9,927 metric tons of maize and 5,423 metric tons of potatoes. 

There is also potential for tapping cultural, eco and community based tourism 
opportunities in some parts of the Dzongkhag. The existence of many unique and 
age-old cultural and traditional festivals and practices in various places - Drameste 
Ngacham, Yagang Tsechu, and religious sites like Aja Ney, Kengkhar Gewog (some 
households particularly earn their living from their skills in wooden handicrafts) 
provides opportunities for tourism development.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Some of the major challenges that needs to be addressed are:

• With the growth in population and water sources drying up, the provision of 
clean and safe drinking water is a major challenge.
• Small and fragmented landholdings, access to rural credit and human wild life 
conflict are obstacles for commercial farming and development of livestock 
enterprises. Facilities for storage, distribution and marketing of agricultural 
products are a constraint. 


6.2.7.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are 
i) enhancing agricultural production ii) development of cottage and medium 
industries and iii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

The Dzongkhag being located in the sub-tropical region has huge potential for 
production of agricultural products like paddy, barley, maize, potatoes and fruits. 
Therefore, the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agricultural productivity. 
However issues of human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages, lack of adequate 
irrigation, storage and marketing facilities have hampered agricultural productivity. 
The focus in the next five years will be to address these issues in close cooperation 
with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest. 

The development of clean and green industries such as agro-processing, cultural 
industries based on handicrafts production, and tourism and hospitality industries 
have high potential. The Dzongkhag will work with the relevant central agencies to 
develop Mongar as an industrial hub for east and central Bhutan. The completion of 
the Gyelposhing-Nganglam highway and the construction of Bondeyma industrial 
estate during the Eleventh Plan complement the already existing comparative 
advantages of being close to the two domestic airports in Bumthang and Yonphula, 
agro-processing potential and reliable electricity supply. 

While the Dzongkhag was successful in bringing down poverty from 44.7 percent 
in 2007 to 10.5 percent in 2012, there are still pockets of villages where poverty 
levels are still high. Therefore, under the targeted poverty reduction programme, 
six villages namely Changchana/Sheripong, Dak, Gongdue, Salabi, Salipong and 
Yari will be supported through REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable 
livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/

cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional 
support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households within the 
village. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the centre.

6.2.8 Paro Dzongkhag

Paro is situated in the north-western part of the country. It borders Autonomous 
Region of Tibet in the north, Haa in the west and Thimphu in the east. 

The Dzongkhag is administratively divided into ten Gewogs namely Doteng, 
Wangchang, Hungrel, Dogar, Shaba, Dopshari, Tsento, Lamgong, Naja and Lungnyi.

Paro is one of the socio-economically developed Dzongkhags in the country with 
poverty of less than 1 percent and better than average health and education 
indicators. However, unemployment reported is 2.7 percent in 2012 compared to 
the national unemployment rate of 2.1 percent. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Paro to be in high happiness category with a value of 0.807. 

6.2.8.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Paro valley is one of the food baskets of Bhutan. The very fertile land and suitable 
terrain makes agricultural activity one of the major sources of livelihood. The 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

entire valley is suitable for growing varieties of crops such as paddy, wheat, millet, 
potatoes, apple and seasonal vegetables. 

Tourism is another important source of income and employment. With the only 
international airport located in the Dzongkhag and many rich historical and cultural 
attractions such as Paro Dzong, National Museum of Ta Dzong, ruined Drugyel 
Dzong, Paro Taktshang (Tiger’s Nest), Kyichu Monastry etc, tourism has gained 
momentum in the Dzongkhag with the potential to grow and develop further The 
influx of tourists has triggered and promoted a host of business activities including 
hotel industry, and promotion of traditional handicrafts and other souvenir items 
catering to the tourists.

Although much has been achieved, the Dzongkhag faces challenges of water 
shortages especially for drinking and irrigation purposes. The increasing urban 
growth has also put heavy pressure on water resources and farmland which 
could contribute to loss of agricultural land and which could result in reduction of 
agricultural production. Addressing human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortage 
and storage and marketing facilities are critical. 

Other emerging issues of concern are crime, youth challenges, problem of solid 
waste management, pollution, congestion etc.

6.2.8.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are 
i) development of tourism and hospitality services and ii) targeted poverty 
intervention programme.

With relatively high levels of unemployment reported in the Dzongkhag, efforts to 
create productive employment opportunities will be enhanced. The Dzongkhag 
will focus on development of tourism and hospitality services. With the only 
international airport located in the Dzongkhag and many rich cultrual , religious 
and historical heritage, tourism is already a booming industry. However, many of 
the tourists visiting the Dzongkhag are either just passing through or at the most 
spend only about two bed nights in the Dzongkhag. The Dzongkhag in collaboration 
with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses will explore 
development of new tourism products unique to the Dzongkhag to encourage 
tourist to spend more bed nights in Paro. Further, in view of the Dzongkhag’s 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

close proximity to the capital city Thimphu, suitable infrastructure facilities and 
easy access by air, opportunities to develop Paro as a MICE (Meeting, Incentive, 
Conference and Exhibition) destination, both for foreign and local participants, will 
be explored. 

While the overall poverty rates in the Dzongkhag is less than 1 percent, pockets 
exist where poverty levels are relatively high. Under the targeted poverty 
reduction intervention, five villages namely Nubri, Soe Yaksa, Tenchakha, Tsendug 
Goenpa and Bemphu will be supported through REAP Phase II. Income generating 
sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-
help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and 
additional support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households 
within the village. Funds for this prorgamme will be directly provided from the 
centre.

Other issues such as water shortages both for drinking and irrigation purposes, 
human wildlife conflict, rising crime, solid waste management, congestion, 
pollution etc. will be addressed in close cooperation with the relevant central 
agencies.

6.2.9 Pemagatshel Dzongkhag

Pemagatshel, meaning “Blissful Land of the Lotus”, is one of the least developed 
and remotest Dzongkhag located in the southeastern part of the country. The 
Dzongkhag covers an area of about 1023 sq km with elevation ranging from 1000 
to 3,500 meters above sea level and experiences an average annual rainfall of 
1500mm to 3000mm. It shares its borders with the Dzongkhags of Trashigang in 
the north and north-east, Mongar in the north and north-west, Zhemgang in the 
west, Samdrup Jongkhar in the south and south east. 

The Dzongkhag is administratively supported by a Dungkhag in Nganglam 
and eleven Gewogs namely, Chongshing, Chimung, Choekhorling, Dechheling, 
Dungmin, Khar, Nanong, Norbugang, Shumar, Zobel and Yurung.

The Dzongkhag has the second highest levels of poverty after Lhuentse Dzongkhag. 
The high levels of poverty is mainly due to remoteness, limited income generating 
opportunities, land fragmentation, poor quality of land, shortage of water and 
steep and unstable terrain. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The main sources of income for the people of Pemagatshel are from agriculture 
and livestock. Most of the cultivated land is under Tseri cultivation. The main 
cereal crop is maize and other crops like oranges, potatoes, and subtropical fruits 
and vegetables are also grown in most villages. Off-farm income is provided by 
gypsum mining and gypsum powder factory at Khothakpa under Shumar Gewog. 
The minerals available in the Dzongkhag include gypsum, talc and quartzite. 

Due to high levels of poverty, 44 households from very remote places such as Wafai 
(23 households), Chongmashing (8 households), Borphu (9 households), Namkhari 
(2 households), Bainangwoong (2 households) were relocated to Khenadrang. The 
beneficiaries were provided with land and transitional support such as temporary 
shelter, essential food supplies, agricultural inputs, and income generation support. 
The activities consisted of the construction of reservoirs, filtration and sedimentation 
tanks to facilitate proper and continuous water supply; construction of an extended 
classroom & other school facilities; an outreach clinic; 0.6 km farm road; housing and 
power supply support; and sustainable land management. The initial assessment 
reveals that monthly income levels from the sale of eggs and vegetables amounted to 
Nu. 4,000 and the programme has made significant socio-economic improvements 
in the lives of the beneficiaries. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Pemagatshel to be in medium happiness category with a 
value of 0.712. 

6.2.9.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

The completion of Gyalposhing–Nganglam highway and Tsebar-Mikuri–Durungri 
feeder road, the commencement of Dungsam Cement Project, the feasibility of 
establishing a regional hub at Nganglam, the construction of the Pemagatshel Dzong 
and development of new township at Rinchenthang, Nganglam and Denchi are some 
of the major activities in the Dzongkhag during the Eleventh Plan. These projects 
will contribute to greater economic opportunities for the Dzongkhag in terms of 
employment generation, income of households and local trade and commerce. 

The Dzongkhag has potential for cultivation of horticultural crops like cardamom, 
ginger, vegetables and tropical fruits. However, farm labor shortage, lack of storage 
and marketing facilities have not resulted in commensurate increase in the incomes 
of the farmers. Therefore, many of the farmers have shifted to off-farm activities 
such as manual work at the Gypsum mining, road constructions and production 
of cultural, religious and tea items such as Jaling, Dhung, Thonphu poe, Nyashing 
Jurma tea leaves, Thongsa Kamthap and Yurung Bura for their livelihood.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Addressing issues of farm labor shortage, storage and marketing facilities, human 
wildlife conflict, water scarcity etc would result in significant transformation in the 
lives of the people and their livelihoods. 

6.2.9.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on are, 
i) enhancing agricultural productivity, ii) development of small and medium 
industries, and iii) targeted poverty intervention prorgamme

With large number of households dependent on agriculture for their livelihood, 
the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agricultural productivity. Efforts to 
enhance production of maize, paddy, cardamom, ginger, vegetables and tropical 
fruits will be made by investing in facilities such as irrigation, storage, packaging 
and marketing, facilitating establishment of farmers’ groups/cooperatives and 
addressing human wildlife conflict. 

Pemagatshel Dzongkhag is famous for production of items such as Jaling, Dhung, 
Thonphu poe, Nyashing Jurma tea leaves, Thongsa Kamthap and Yurung Bura. The 
Dzongkhag will explore possibilities of establishing organized small and medium 
cultural industries. The Dzongkhag in cooperation with Agency for Promotion of 
Indigenous Crafts will facilitate product development, quality assurance, marketing 
of the products, and sustainable management of raw material and establishment 
of raw material banks in the Dzongkhag. 

Under the targeted poverty reduction programme, five villages namely Chephung, 
Kerong, Laishingri, Mikuri-Bangyul and Nyaskhar will be supported through 
REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of 
the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels will be 
provided to the poorest households within the village. Funds for this programme 
will be provided directly from the centre.

Further, rehabilitation of 51 households in Borangmo, Nganglam is ongoing with 
the construction of a 4.7 km farm road and an Outreach Clinic; house construction 
support and water and electricity supply. The feasibility and geo tech studies for 
rehabilitation in Tanzama, Norbugang Gewog, Nganglam has been completed and 
the preliminary planning and designing are underway.

Punakha Dzongkhag is well known for rice, vegetables and fruits owing to its 
favourable location, soil and climatic conditions. The Dzongkhag basically grows 
a little of everything but the main crops are paddy, wheat, maize and mustard. 
Though citrus fruits are among the main fruits grown in the Dzongkhag, other 
fruits like persimmon, guavas, peaches, plums, pears and apples are also grown. 
The Dzongkhag also grows a variety of vegetables such as chilies, radish, cabbages, 
brinjals, green leaf vegetables and tomatoes.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The Dzongkhag is also a popular tourist destination. Punakha Dzong is a major 
attraction besides Chhimi Lhakhang, and the two hot springs, namely Koma Tshachu 
and the Chhubu Tshachu.

The 2010 GNH Index reports Punakha to be in high happiness category with a 
value of 0.770. 

6.2.10.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The conducive climatic condition enables the people to produce surplus rice, 
fruits and vegetables which are sold in neighboring Dzongkhags i.e Thimphu and 
Wangduephodrang. The Dzongkhag is one of the largest producers of rice in the 
country.

The Dzongkhag also has potential to be developed as a unique tourist destination for 
both international and domestic tourists. The income generated and employment 
created through tourism contributes immensely to the growth and development 
of the local economy.

The development of the Punatsangchu hydroelectricity projects I and II offers 
opportunities for further development of the Dzongkhag. 

Some of the issues include the threat of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF), 
the unplanned growth of Lobesa town (located at the tri junction of Thimphu, 
Punakha and Wangduephodrang highway) and issues related to water scarcity, 
human wildlife conflict and emerging social issues.

6.2.10.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
development of tourism services, and ii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

Efforts to promote cultural and eco-tourism in close coordination with the Tourism 
Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses will be enhanced. Punakha 
is famous for its idyllic and serene natural setting, with wooded hills, lush green 
valleys and the Phochhu and Mochhu rivers flowing by. Attractions such as Punakha 
Domchoe and Tshechu are very popular festivals. There are other places of historical 
and cultural significance which provide a great opportunity for promoting cultural 
and eco-tourism. Besides tapping this rich source of religious and cultural heritage 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

and traditions for tourism purposes the Dzongkhag will promote bird watching, 
rafting, kayaking and cultural trekking in the valley. 

Economic opportunities provided by the construction of Punatsangchhu 
hydroelectricity project I and II to boost the local economy, trade and commerce 
and employment potential will be optimized.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, five villages namely Gumgang, 
Kewana, Nidupchu, Yorbo and Chimcheyna will be supported through REAP Phase 
II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and 
establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions 
at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to 
the poorest households within the village. The funds for this programme will be 
directly provided from the centre. 

In addition, the Dzongkhag will ensure that issues of human wildlife conflict, 
water shortages both for drinking and irrigation purposes, storage and marketing 
facilities for agricultural products, disaster preparedness and management will be 
addressed in close coordination with the relevant central agencies.

Maize is the staple crop and is widely cultivated on dry land. Mandarin orange 
and ginger are the main cash crops contributing significantly to the economic 
development of the district. Other crops grown include paddy, millet, mustard, 
legumes, buckwheat, and potato. 

In the Tenth Plan, under the Rural Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) I 
support was provided to Lauri village. Through the programme dairy cooperative 
was established and high yielding jersey cows supplied to the beneficiaries in 
addition to dairy equipment. 

6.2.11.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Favorable climatic conditions and plane arable land offer potential for farm 
mechanization thereby enhancing agricultural productivity. The Dzongkhag also 
has the comparative advantage to market RNR produces due to its proximity 
to the Indian market and well connected network of 244 km farm roads. With 
adequate irrigation facilities, the Dzongkhag has an opportunity of producing 
3880 MT paddy annually and 7659 MT of maize annually. Besides farm products, 
sustainable harvesting of Non Wood Forest Products (NWFP) such as Chirata, Rubia 
and Satuwa and livestock products such as milk, pork, fish, chicken, and beef have 
potential to enhance household incomes.

The plan to develop Motanga Industrial Estate in the Eleventh Plan in the Dzongkhag, 
and a rich mineral base will provide huge opportunities for establishment of 
medium and large agro-processing and mineral based industries in the Dzongkhag. 

Further, the construction of Dewathang-Nganglam (74.50km), Samdrupcholing 
-Samrang (24 km), Samrang-Jomotshangkha (85.20Km) and the upgradation of 
Samdrup-Jongkhar-Tashigang highways will further improve access and connectivity. 

However, some of the major challenges faced by the Dzongkhag are human wildlife 
conflict, farm labour shortages, lack of adequate irrigation, storage and marketing 
facilities. 

6.2.11.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
industrial development, ii) agricultural and livestock development and iii) targeted 
poverty intervention programme.



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Samdrup Jongkhar Dzongkhag has a huge potential for developing as an industrial 
hub of the east. Its proximity to the large Indian market, rich mineral reserves such 
as coal, dolomite, and high grade limestone, agricultural potential, the construction 
of southern east-west highway and the establishment of an industrial estate at 
Motanga provides comparative advantage. The Dzongkhag in collaboration with 
the relevant central agencies will explore possibilities of developing niche medium 
and large industries in the Dzongkhag. The development of such industries will 
help in employment generation, improving household income and reducing 
poverty. 

The Dzongkhag has lot of agricultural and livestock potential. Maize, mandarin 
orange, ginger, paddy, millet, mustard, legumes, buckwheat, potato and variety 
of vegetables are grown. In terms of livestock products, milk, pork, fish, chicken, 
and beef have potential. The Dzongkhag will put in place appropriate strategies 
to enhance agricultural and livestock productivity in particular to tackle human 
wildlife conflict, address farm labour shortages, irrigation facilities, and strengthen 
storage, distribution and marketing infrastructure. 

With high levels of poverty in the Dzongkhag, implementation of targeted 
poverty intervention programmes will be the key strategy. Under the programme, 
five poorest villages in the Dzongkhag namely, Philuma under Orong Gewog, 
Kakaney and Tshotsalo under Martshalla Gewog, Yarphu under Wangphu Gewog 
and Monmola under Serthi Gewog are being supported through REAP Phase II. 
Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and 
establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives are some of the interventions 
being implemented. Further, under the National Rehabilitation Programme, 
rehabilitation of 31 poor households in Dawathang, Langchenphu Gewog is 
underway with the construction of a 2.6 km farm road, power and water supply 
and support to house construction. The funds for this programme will be directly 
provided from the centre.

6.2.12 Sarpang Dzongkhag

Sarpang Dzongkhag is situated in the south-central part of the country and shares 
its 200 kilometers southern border with the Indian state of Assam, to its east is 
Zhemgang Dzongkhag, to west lies Tsirang and to its north Trongsa Dzongkhag. 
Around three quarters of its land is under forest cover mostly consisting of the 
broad leaf sub-tropical evergreen trees. The Dzongkhag is located in the sub-
tropical climatic zone, extending from an elevation of 200 meters to 3,600 metres, 
from the Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in the west to the Manas National Park in the 
east. 

The Dzongkhag is supported by 12 Gewogs namely Gelephu, Samtenling, Sershong, 
Chuzagang, Umling, Tareythang, Jigmecholing, Gakidling, Dekiling, Sengye, 
Chhuzergang and Shompangkha, and a Drungkhag and a Thromde in Gelephu.

Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Sarpang Dzongkhag’s poverty incidence of 4.2 percent is below the national poverty 
incidence of 12 percent in 2012. However, unemployment rate of 3.6 percent is 
second highest after Thimphu. The 2010 GNH Index reports Sarpang to be in high 
happiness category with a value of 0.795.

Paddy, maize wheat and millet are some of the major crops grown in the Dzongkhag. 
whereas orange, areca nut, cardamom and ginger are the principal cash crops 
grown by the farmers. 

The Central Regional Referral Hospital is located in Gelephu. In the Eleventh Plan, 
a new 150 bedded hospital will be constructed which will not only benefit Sarpang 
but also the other five central Dzongkhags.

The road access to Indian markets for the five central Dzongkhag is through 
Sarpang. Sarpang Dzongkhag is also connected with domestic air services with the 
establishment of an airport in the Tenth Plan.

6.2.12.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The Dzongkhag’s proximity to Indian markets, availability of vast flat land, air 
connectivity, and reliable electricity supply with the completion of Tsirang-
Jigmeling electricity transmission line provides significant economic opportunities 
for Sarpang. in Addition, the planned development of Jigmeling Industrial Estate, 
establishment of dry port, upgradation of domestic airport to international 
standard and the completion of Lamoizingkha-Sarpang and Gelephu-Panbang 
highways (parts of southern east-west highway) are expected to further boost the 
comparative advantage of the Dzongkhag. The Dzongkhag also has potential for 
timber and mineral based industries. 

Favorable terrain and climatic conditions combined with the fertile agriculture land 
offer tremendous opportunity for farm mechanization and commercial agriculture 
and horticulture development. Different varieties of crops can be grown in the 
Dzongkhag due to its warm weather and humidity. Also, Sarpang has potential 
for sustainable harvesting of NWFPs such as bamboo, cane, aromatic herbs and 
incense and enhancing livestock production such as eggs, poultry, fish and pork. 

However, agriculture and livestock productivity is challenged by human wildlife 
conflict, lack of adequate irrigation facilities, and lack of storage and marketing 
facilities. 

Although the overall poverty rate of Sarpang Dzongkhag is low compared to the 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

national average of 12 percent, there are settlements within the Dzongkhag which 
are very remote and where poverty rates are very high. One such village was Reti 
in Sarpang which received targeted poverty intervention support under Rural 
Economy Advancement Programme (REAP) I. Addressing health, education and 
living standards disparities within the Dzongkhag will be a key challenge.

6.2.12.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are 
i) industrial development, ii) enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity and 
iii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

The Dzongkhag in collaboration with the relevant central agencies will work towards 
developing Gelephu as a major industrial hub given the economic opportunities 
and other comparative advantages as a gateway to central Bhutan, and in terms of 
land availability, accessibility by air, land and railway in near future. Efforts will also 
be made to establish a dry port in Gelephu. 

The Dzongkhag will also put in place appropriate strategies to enhance agricultural 
and livestock productivity. The issues of human wildlife conflict, irrigation, farm 
labour shortages, and storage, distribution and marketing facilities particularly for 
agricultural products will be addressed.

Under the targeted poverty reduction programme, five villages namely Balatung, 
Pemachhoeling, Tinjurey, Torkey and Bhagjungey will be supported through 
REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some 
of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels 
will be provided to the poorest households within the village. The funds for this 
programme will be directly provided from the centre.

6.2.13 Samtse Dzongkhag

Samtse Dzongkhag is situated in the in southwestern foothills of the country. It 
is bordered by Chukha Dzongkhag in the east, Haa Dzongkhag in the north and 
Indian states of West Bengal and Sikkim in the south and west respectively. Samtse 
is at an elevation of 600-800m above sea-level and lies in the sub-tropical monsoon 
climate zone with good forest cover. There are two Dungkhags namely Dorokha 
and Trashichholing and fifteen Gewogs namely Norgaygang, Pemaling, Sang Ngag 
Chhoeling, Norboogang, Denchukha, Dophuchen, Dungtoed, Namgyelchholing, 
Phuntshopelri, Samtse, Trashichholing, Tadhing, Tendruk, Ugyentse and Yoeseltse.

In the last five years, poverty incidence was reduced from 46.8 percent in 2007 to 
22.2 percent in 2012 in Samtse. While this is a significant achievement, poverty 
still remains high and was almost twice the national average of 12 percent in 2012. 
The high level of poverty is attributed to low levels of literacy in the Dzongkhag. 
The general literacy was 49.8 percent against national average of 63 percent, 
second lowest in the country, youth literacy was 70.6 percent compared to national 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

average of 86.1 percent and adult literacy of 40.2 percent against national average 
of 55.3 percent. The 2010 GNH Index reports Samtse to be in medium happiness 
category with a value of 0.736.

In an effort to accelerate poverty reduction in the Dzongkhag, Sanu Dungtoe was 
selected as one of the ten poorest villages under REAP I in the Tenth Five Year Plan. 
Through the programme people of Sanu Dungtoe were provided skills in traditional 
carpentry, mill and poultry farms were established to enhance their income and 
livelihood. 

With three hospitals at Samtse, Sipsu and Gomtu, nine BHUs, two indigenous units 
and 18 outreach clinics, the Dzongkhag enjoys a good degree of health coverage 
with most households with access to health facility. Further, the construction of a 
new 40 bedded hospital in the Eleventh Plan will help improve health coverage. 

6.2.13.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Samtse with its warm climate and rich fertile land has high potential to increase 
cash crop production and also has opportunities for double cropping. The flat arable 
land is suitable for farm mechanization. Paddy, maize, wheat, buckwheat, barley 
and millet are some of the cereal crops grown in Samtse. Among the cash crop, 
cardamom, mandarin, areca nut, ginger and wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
are grown. The Dzongkhag also has rich forest resources particularly bamboo, cane 
and incense plants, and sustainable extraction of these products will contribute to 
rural income generation. The Dzongkhag has potential for development of bamboo 
treatment and preservation industry and cane furniture production. 

Minerals such as limestone and dolomite are also found in Samtse. 

Further, proximity to the Indian markets, the completion of Samtse-Phuentsholing 
highway and the establishment of Damdhum Industrial Estate will provide huge 
opportunities for economic growth in Samtse. 

In terms of the challenges, increasing agriculture and livestock productivity is 
constrained by human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages, lack of adequate 
irrigation facilities, and lack of storage and marketing facilities.

High levels of illiteracy resulting in low quality of employment and high poverty 
rates is a major concern. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

6.2.13.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
targeted poverty intervention programme ii) improving education outcomes and 
iii) industrial development.

Samtse has the fourth highest levels of poverty in the country. Therefore, one key 
strategy will be the implementation of the targeted poverty reduction programme. 
Under the programme, five villages namely Khempa, Gibjee, Kamai Banzang, 
Majuwa and Cibichang will be supported under REAP Phase II. Income generating 
sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-
help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and 
additional support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households 
within the village. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the 
centre. 

The Poverty Analysis Report 2012 indicates a direct correlation between poverty 
levels and education. People with low literacy rate were poorer and there was a 
significant reduction in poverty rate if the household head attended secondary 
levels of education both in urban and rural Bhutan. The low level of literacy is one 
of the main factors for high poverty rates in the Dzongkhag. Therefore, improving 
education outcome will be a priority. The Dzongkhag will work closely with the 
Ministry of Education to ensure adequate infrastructure facilities, teachers and 
teaching materials are made available and where relevant consolidation of schools 
to improve quality and efficiency of education will be explored. 

The close proximity to the Indian market, availability of mineral reserve base, wide 
variety of agricultural products, and the completion of Samtse-Phuentsholing 
highway and the Dhamdum Industrial Estate in the Eleventh Plan offer opportunities 
for Samtse to develop as medium and large scale industrial hub. The Dzongkhag 
in close consultation with the relevant central agencies will work towards creating 
an enabling environment in the Dzongkhag for establishment of medium and large 
scale industries. The industries could be mineral based, agro-based or wood/cane 
based. 

The Dzongkhag will also put in place appropriate strategies to tackle human wildlife 
conflict, address farm labour shortages, and strengthen storage, distribution and 
marketing facilities, particularly for agricultural products, drinking water shortages etc.

elevations ranging from 400 to 2000 m above sea level. It shares its border with 
Wangdue Phodrang Dzongkhag to the north, Sarpang to the east and southeast 
and Dagana to the west and southeast. There are twelve Gewogs namely Barshong, 
Mendrelgang, Tsholingkhar, Tsirangtoe, Dunglagang, Kilkhorthang, Sergithang, 
Rangthangling, Gosaling, Semjong, Phuentenchu and Patsaling.

The poverty incidence is reported at 14.8 percent in 2012, an increase from 13. 9 
percent in 2007. The Dzongkhag also reports a lower general literacy rate, mean 
annual household income and higher unemployment rates compared to the 
national average. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Tsirang to be in high happiness category with a value 
of 0.770. 

Agriculture and livestock are two important source of livelihood. Paddy, maize and

millet are the major cereal crops grown while orange, cardamom and vegetables 
are the principal cash crops. Mandarin constitutes an important source of cash 
income for most of the farmers. Livestock rearing is also an important economic 
activity with poultry, piggery and fisheries contributing to income generation. 

6.2.14.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The favourable climatic conditions and diverse agro-ecological features present 
potential in enhancing agriculture production. RNR Statistics 2012 reports that 
the Dzongkhag produced about 2464 MT of vegetables, 843 MT of milk, 947100 
dozens of eggs, 44 MT of chicken, 26 MT of pork, 4 MT of fish in 2011. 

Further, opportunities exist for tourism development. Tourism products such as 
bicycle trips, river rafting and kayaking on Sunkosh river, trekking routes (old route 
from Damphu to Gelephu in 3 days and Damphu to Wangdue in 7 days) and flower 
tours could be explored. Being strategically located along Wangdue-Sarpang 
national highway, opportunities in terms of development of hospitality and related 
services are also possible. 

Moreover, the completion of electricity transmission line between Basochhu 
and Tsirang and the commissioning of Dagachhu hydroelectricity project will 
enhance electricity supply reliability in the Dzongkhag providing opportunities for 
establishment of new industries, particularly cottage, small and medium industries. 

Amongst others, one major challenge is poverty reduction. Tsirang is one of the 
Dzongkhag reporting higher incidences of poverty. Other challenges include water 
shortage, human wildlife conflict and urban problems of solid waste management, 
infrastructure etc.

6.2.14.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, ii) tourism development targeted, 
and iii) poverty intervention programme.

With agriculture and livestock products being a major source of livelihood for the 
people of Tsirang, the Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agricultural and livestock 
production. The Dzongkhag will invest in improving infrastructure facilities such 
as farm roads and market sheds, addressing issues of water shortage both for 
drinking and irrigation purposes, farm labour shortage and human wildlife conflict. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Establishment of cooperatives and farmers group in agriculture and livestock will 
be encouraged and facilitated. 

The Dzongkhag in collaboration with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local 
communities and businesss will explore possibilities of developing new tourism 
development products such as bicycle, trekking routes, river rafting, nature tour, 
homestays/farmhouses for community based tourism etc to attract tourist to the 
Dzongkhag. 

In order to provide better health care services, a new hospital will be constructed in 
Tsirang during the Eleventh Plan. The Dzongkhag will also put in place appropriate 
strategies in cooperation with relevant central agencies to address drinking water 
shortages, urban infrastructure facilities and services and improving health and 
education outcomes.

In addition to REAP II, the rehabilitation of around 25 poor and disadvantaged 
households from Serzhong village in Tsirang will be supported under National 
Rehabilitation Programme in the Eleventh Plan.

With high levels of poverty in the Dzongkhag, the implementation of targeted 
poverty reduction programme will be a key strategy to accelerate poverty reduction. 
Under the programme, five villages namely Baithrakay, Pangthang, Toisang, 
Tathang and Balakhap will be supported through REAP Phase II. Income generating 
sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-
help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and 
additional support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households 
within the village. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the 
centre.

3.2.15 Trashigang Dzongkhag

Trashigang Dzongkhag is the largest and the most populous Dzongkhag in the 
country. It shares its borders with Mongar Dzongkhag in the west, Samdrup 
Jongkhar and Pemagatshel in the South, Trashi Yangtse in the north and the Indian 
state of Arunachal Pradesh in the east. It is situated at an elevation ranging from 
600-4,500 meters above sea level. The climate is mainly temperate with an annual 
rainfall between 1000 mm and 2000 mm. There are three Dungkhags (namely 
Sagteng, Wamrong and Thrimshing) and fifteen Gewogs namely Bartsham, 
Bidung, Kanglung, Kangpara, Khaling, Lumang, Merak, Phongmey, Radhi, Sakteng, 
Samkhar, Shongphu, Thrimshing, Udzorong and Yangneer. Dangmechhu, which is 
one of the largest river in the country flows through the Dzongkhag.

Agriculture and livestock rearing are the main source of livelihood. Maize, Soya 
beans and beans are the major crops grown in the Dzongkhag. Among the 
horticultural products, potato, radish, asparagus, cabbage and chillies have the 
potential to be cultivated on a commercial scale. 

The only domestic airport in the eastern part of the country is located at Yongphula, 
Trashigang. The widening of Trashigang and Samdrup Jongkhar highway is ongoing 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

and once completed the travel time on this important highway will be reduced 
significantly.

The 2010 GNH Index reports Trashigang to be in medium happiness category with 
a value of 0.708. 

3.2.15.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

Trashigang has a number of cultural and religious attractions such as the Trashigang 
Dzong, Kanglung Zangdopelri, the typical architecture of Mithidrang town, 
Trashigang Tshechu and the unique pastoral communities of Merak and Sakten. 
The Dzongkhag is also known for its traditional skills of weaving and dyeing. The 
Dzongkhag is also a home to many natural reserves with rich and varied flora 
and fauna and endangered species. This provides opportunities for tourism 
development in the Dzongkhag by promoting weaving tours, wildlife tours, day 
hiking and camping tours. Further, with the improvement of the domestic airport 
in Yongphula during the Eleventh Plan access to the Dzongkhag will be easier. 

In terms of road connectivity, all fifteen Gewogs will be connected with farm and 
feeder roads once the ongoing Gewog connectivity road at Merak and Sakteng is 
completed. This will provide better opportunities for the farmers to access markets 
for their agricultural and livestock products outside their Gewogs. While maize, 
paddy, soya bean and bean are the major crops in the Dzongkhag, maize is grown 
in all the 15 Gewogs of the Dzongkhag and in sizable quantities (9,974 metric tons 
– RNR Statistic 2012). Therefore, potential exists for establishing collection centers 
for maize and establishment of maize processing units. 

In addition, plans to develop Kanglung as one of the regional hubs in the east, 
renovation of Trashigang Dzong and the establishment of Centenary Institute of 
Education in Yongphula will boost opportunities for education, trade and commerce 
in the Dzongkhag.

Some of the challenges faced by the Dzongkhag include rural urban migration. 
The PHCB 2005 reports that Trashigang had the highest migration loss of 16,697 
persons. This has resulted in agricultural land being kept fallow due to farm 
labour shortages and land fragmentation leading to low agricultural productivity. 
Other challenges faced by the Dzongkhag include human wildlife conflict, water 
shortages both for drinking and irrigation purposes etc.

3.2.15.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-economic 
Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) development 
of Kanglung as a regional hub ii) enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, iii) 
tourism development and iv) targeted poverty intervention programme.

The Dzongkhag faces the highest levels of rural urban migration with large number 
of people migrating out to other Dzongkhags. Therefore, in order to address the 
rural-urban migration and to create better economic opportunities for people 
living in the region the development of a regional hub in Kanglung will be explored 
during the Eleventh Plan. A preliminary study indicates high potential if the issue 
of water supply can be addressed. In particular the Dzongkhag will look into the 
possibilities of establishing Kanglung as an educational hub.

With agriculture and livestock being the main source of livelihood, the Dzongkhag 
will focus on enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity by addressing the 
issues of storage and marketing facilities, human wildlife conflict, irrigation facilities, 
farm labour shortages and establishment of farmers’ groups/cooperatives. The 
Dzongkhag will also explore possibilities of establishing small and medium industries 
which have potential for creating jobs and enhancing households. Small and medium 
industries based on agro-processing, tourism and hospitality services have potential. 

With the establishment of domestic air service at Yongphula, Trashigang has 
good prospects in terms of attracting larger numbers of visitors. Initiatives will be 
undertaken to develop tourism in the Dzongkhag with support and coordination 
with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses. The 
Dzongkhag will focus on developing new products that will increase the number of 
bed nights tourist spend in Trashigang so that the local economy and households 
benefit. New products such as trekking routes, nature tours like bird watching, and 
adventure tourism will be developed. Merak-Sakten will be promoted as a unique 
and exotic destination.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, six villages namely Kheree, 
Banyalting, Khaimanma, Ngambinang, Khashateng and Kheliphu will be supported 
through REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some 
of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels 
will be provided to the poorest households within the village. The funds for this 
programme will be directly provided from the centre.

The poverty incidence in Trashiyangtse has dropped to 13.5 percent in 2012 from 
14.3 percent in 2007. The 2010 GNH Index reports Trashiyangtse to be in low 
happiness category with a value of 0.698. 

Agriculture and livestock farming is the main source of livelihood for majority of the 
population. Rice, maize, millet, buckwheat and wheat are the major cereal crops 
grown. While orange, potatoes and chilly are the main cash crops of the Dzongkhag. 
Trashiyangtse is known for the production of traditional handicraft like wooden bowl 
(“Dapa”) and Daphne paper (“Desho”). Trashiyangtse is endowed with Cordyceps in 
the pastoral areas which fetches a very high price through exports.

Trashiyangtse is also known for its rich biological diversity with Bumdeling Wildlife 
Sanctuary being well known as the winter habitat and roosting place for Black-
Necked Cranes, a highly endangered species of bird in the world. The Bhutan Glory 
butterfly is also found here. There are possibilities of discovering very rare species 
of flora and fauna in the conservation area of Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary. 

6.2.16.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The 600 MW Kholongchhu Hydropower Project which is under construction provides 
lot of opportunities for local economy growth. Once completed, the project will 
contribute towards enhancing electricity supply and reliability thereby creating 
opportunities for establishing small and medium industries in the Dzongkhag. The 
significant increase in the number of project workers in the Dzongkhag during the 
construction period will help boost local trade and commerce and employment 
opportunities for the Bhutanese. 

The Dzongkhag has opportunities for developing small and cottage industries 
specializing in wooden, handmade paper and agricultural/medicinal plant products

With the establishment of domestic airport in Yongphula, the accessibility to 
Trashiyangtse has been made easier. The numerous heritage sites and major 
festivals such as the annual Gomphu Kora and Chorten Kora festivals, Chazam (iron 
bridge), the black necked cranes and handicrafts tours could be attractive products 
for tourism development. 

Some of the challenges include lack of proper tourist amenities such as hotels. 

In addition, depleting forest resources has posed a challenge to the people making 
‘Dapa’ (wooden bowl). The situation is further compounded by fewer youth willing 
to take up the trade which was traditionally passed on as a family trade usually 
from father to son.

In terms of agriculture, the fragmented land-holdings, farm labour shortage, 
human wildlife conflict, lack of storage and marketing facilities pose constraint to 
enhancing agricultural productivity. 

6.2.16.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on are i) 
enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, ii) tourism development and 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

harnessing economic potential from the construction of the 600 MW Kholongchhu 
Hydropower Project, and iii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

Trashiyangtse Dzongkhag will focus on enhancing agricultural and livestock 
productivity by investing in agriculture infrastructure, farm mechanization to address 
farm labour shortages, overcoming human wildlife conflict, and constructing irrigation, 
storage and marketing facilities. Possibilities of establishing small food processing 
units will be explored. In addition, farmers will be encouraged to form groups to avail 
better market and rural credit and also to be in a position to supply large quantities of 
agricultural/livestock products to Kholongchhu hydropower project. 

To supplement farm income, the Dzongkhag will also focus on development of 
tourism facilities and services. The Dzongkhag will liaise closely with Tourism 
Council of Bhutan, local communities and businesses to develop Trashiyangste as 
an exotic tourist destination and facilitate development of new tourism products 
specific to the Dzongkhag such as trekking path, black neck crane festival, 
handicraft tours, water sports and religious and cultural tours which could also 
cater to domestic tourists. The Dzongkhag will also facilitate to develop tourist 
infrastructure facilities like guesthouses, home/farm stays, community lodges 
and camping trails. The local entrepreneurs and communities will be provided 
necessary training on tourism and hospitality services. 

With reliable electricity supply available, the Dzongkhag will explore development 
of cottage and small industries to enhance household incomes and create jobs 
for the local communities. The Dzongkhag in close collaboration with the Agency 
for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts and the Department of Cottage and Small 
Industries will facilitate an enabling environment for development of cottage 
and small industries by addressing issues such as access to finance, markets, raw 
materials and product development.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, five villages namely Pangthang, 
Ngalimang, Dukti, Karmazom and Kuenzangling will be supported through REAP 
Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development 
and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions 
at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to the 
poorest households within the village. The funds for this programme will be directly 
provided from the centre.

6.2.17 Trongsa Dzongkhag

Historically, Trongsa is one of the most important Dzongkhags. It is the seat of the 
Trongsa Penlop and, the formal investiture of the Crown Prince of Bhutan as the 
Trongsa Penlop is observed in this Tongsa Dzong. 

Trongsa Dzongkhag is located in the heart of the country with elevation ranging from 
800 meters to 4,800 meters above sea level. It shares its boundaries with Bumthang 
Dzongkhag to the northeast, Wangdue Phodrang to the west and Zhemgang to the 
south. The Dzongkhag is home to the famous Jigme Singye Wangchuck National 
Park which covers an area of 1723 sq.km and is home to many globally endangered 
flora and fauna, including the Golden Languar. The Dzongkhag has five Gewogs 
namely Drakteng, Korphu, Nubi, Langthel and Tangsibji.

While the mean annual household income is slightly above the national average 
of Nu. 164,829, poverty incidence remained high at 14.9 percent in 2012. Trongsa 
Dzongkhag also has high rate of unemployment of 3.2 percent. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Trongsa to be in low happiness category with a value

of 0.684.

Agriculture is the main occupation and main source of income for the majority 
of the population. Farmers grow almost all kinds of crops, and in some areas, 
potatoes are the main source of cash income. 

The 720 MW Mangdechhu Hydroelectric project is located on the left bank of 
Mangdechhu. The project construction started in 2010 and is scheduled to be 
completed by 2017-18.

6.2.17.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Trongsa has suitable climatic conditions which is conducive for enhancing 
agricultural and horticultural products, besides livestock products such as poultry, 
piggery and dairy backyard farming. 

With the presence of numerous cultural and religious heritage structures and sites, 
and its location on the national highway, the number of tourists visiting Trongsa is 
increasing every year. Presently, there exists an eco-tourism trail which connects 
the sacred places like Nabji Lhakang, Kubra, Ugen Drak and Phumzur Lhakhang. A 
Royal Heritage Trail from Bumthang to Trongsa has been opened, further boosting 
the tourism growth in both the Dzongkhags.

The Dzongkhag however faces acute shortage of hospitality and other tourists 
facilities and services which are very important especially during the peak tourist 
seasons. Currently, there are only three resorts/guesthouses/hotels which meet 
the service standards for international tourists. 

The Dzongkhag is also confronted with the problem of small and fragmented land 
holdings. Many farmers do not own land and depend on sharecropping. Hence 
any efforts towards cash crop and commercial farming are confronted with the 
problems associated with the pattern of land holdings. Other challenges faced 
by the farmers include farm labour shortage, human wildlife conflict, shortage of 
water, and lack of storage and marketing facilities.

6.2.17.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity, ii) tourism development, ii) 
facilitating establishment of cottage, small and medium enterprises, and iii) 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

targeted poverty intervention programme.

Agriculture and Livestock productivity - The challenges of small and fragmented 
land holdings will be addressed by providing high yielding seeds, establishment 
of farmer groups/ cooperatives, and training on new and efficient cropping 
technologies. Issues of irrigation facilities, human wildlife conflicts, marketing 
and storage will be addressed. Efforts shall also be made to improve livestock 
productivity through introduction of improved breed of livestock AI programmes 
and supply of pure jerseys cows. Besides, programmes to increase productivity will 
include improved pasture management and feed and fodder development plans. 

Promoting Tourism - In close collaboration with the Tourism Council of Bhutan, 
local communities and businesses the Dzongkhag will facilitate development of 
tourism infrastructure such as hotels, community lodges, farm houses, etc, and 
new products unique to the Dzongkhag based on local handicrafts products, 
culture, history and eco-tourism trails. 

Facilitating Establishment of Cottage, Small and Medium Enterprises - The 
commissioning of Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Power project in 2017-18 provides an 
excellent opportunity for development of cottage, small, and medium enterprises 
and industries. The Dzongkhag in collaboration with the central ministries will 
support and help in identifying potential enterprises and industries. In addition 
to investments in urban development, market sheds, processing plants, cold 
storages, produce collection centres shall be built in appropriate places at Gewog 
and Dzongkhag to support the growth of micro, small and farm enterprises. 

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, five villages namely Phumzur, 
Pangzur, Thangyel, Bayzam and Wangling will receive support through REAP Phase 
II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and 
establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions 
at village level and additional support at households levels will be provided to 
the poorest households within the village. The funds for this programme will be 
directly provided from the centre.

Poverty incidence in Thimphu Dzongkhag was reduced from 2.4 percent in 2007 
to 0.5 percent in 2012. The mean annual household income is almost double the 
national average in 2012 and the health and education indicators report significantly 
better outcomes compared to the rest of the country. However, unemployment 
rate was twice the national average. The high rate of unemployment is attributed 
to high levels of inmigration to Thimphu, mostly youth. 

The 2010 GNH Index reports Thimphu to be in high happiness category with a 
value of 0.773. 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The majority of Thimphu resident are engaged in trade and commerce, construction 
and service sectors. 

In remote Gewogs such as Soe, Naro, Lingzhi, Geneykha and Dagala, the majority 
of people are engaged in agriculture and livestock farming. The main agricultural 
products are paddy, wheat, mustard and beans which are grown for commercial 
purposes. Vegetables such as chillies, potatoes, radish and turnip are also grown 
in all the Gewogs. Fruits like plums, walnuts, apricots, apples, pears and peaches 
are grown for commercial purpose. Apple is grown on a large scale for export to 
the neighboring countries of India and Bangladesh. Chilly is a vegetable grown on 
a commercial basis. Livestock rearing is another important occupation for the rural 
people with most farmers establishing back yard dairy and poultry farms. 

6.2.18.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Thimphu being the capital city, is well endowed with socio-economic infrastructure 
facilitates and better economic opportunities. This has lead to high rate of inward 
migration with number of people from other Dzongkhags moving to Thimphu in 
search of jobs and better health and education services. The rapid rate of inward 
migration is not only putting extra pressure on existing infrastructure facilities but 
also creating new challenges for the Dzongkhag such as the followings:

• What used to be green agricultural fields just a few years ago has now been 
converted into commercial, institutional and housing apartments, roads, 
bridges etc. This has lead to lower agricultural productivity in the Dzongkhag. 
The Dzongkhag reports the lowest levels of forest coverage at 42.86 percent 
(RNR Statistic 2012). 
• Issues of urban waste management, housing and water shortages, pollution, 
congestion etc are on the rise.
• Rapid urbanization has also led to emerging social issues such as youth engaging 
in anti-social activities partly due to high levels of youth unemployment, rising 
crime, growing urban poverty, gradual loss of the close knit community ties, etc. 
• The neighbouring areas like Khasadrapchu, Kawang and Depsi are growing 
rapidly. Therefore, there is an urgent need to ensure local area plans for these 
areas are finalized to avoid unplanned growth of these areas.




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

The Dzongkhag has opportunities for enhancing agricultural production as paddy, 
wheat, mustard, beans and vegetables such as chillies, potatoes, radish and turnip 
are grown in all the Gewogs. However, issues of human wildlife conflict, storage 
and marketing, water etc need to be addressed to optimize opportunities.

The interior Gewogs of Soe, Naro, Dagala and Lingzhi have potential in enhancing 
their income from sustainable harvesting of non-wood forest based products such 
as cordyceps and medicinal plants, besides livestock. Similarly, Geney Gewog has 
potential for sustainable harvesting of masutake and other mushrooms.

6.2.18.3 Strategies 

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are 
i) agriculture and livestock development and improving health and education 
outcomes, and ii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

Development of agriculture and livestock outcomes will be through enhancing 
production by addressing issues of water shortages, human wildlife conflict, storage 
and marketing facilities, besides providing proactive extension support services. 

Further improvement of health and education services will be undertaken 
by constructing a new 40 bedded District hospital in Thimphu and educational 
infrastructure will be rationalized to improve delivery of education services. 

Other major infrastructure investment planned in the Dzongkhag during the 
Eleventh Plan are the construction of Public Health Laboratory, construction of 
National Rehabilitation Resource Centre, permanent craft bazaar, renovation of 
Phajoding Goenpa and restoration of Lingzhi Dzong.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, four villages namely 
Dangochang, Chebesa, Barchong and Tshochekha will be supported through 
REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity 
development and establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some 
of the interventions at village level and additional support at household levels 
will be provided to the poorest households within the village. The funds for this 
programme will be directly provided from the centre.

6.2.19 Wangduephodrang Dzongkhag 

Wangduephodrang Dzongkhag is the second largest Dzongkhag. It is situated at 
an elevation ranging from 800 to 5800 meters above sea level and about 70.28 
percent of its total land area is under forest cover. It is bordered by the Dzongkhags 
of Trongsa in the East, Dagana and Tsirang in the South, and Thimphu and Punakha 
in the West. 

Administratively it is made up of fifteen Gewogs namley Athang, Bjena, Daga, 
Dangchhu, Gangtey, Gasetshogom, Gasetshowom, Kazhi, Nahi, Nyisho, Phangyul, 
Phobjikha, Ruepaisa, Sephu and Thedtsho. Phobjikha Gewog is famous as the winter 
roosting place of the black necked cranes. The Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Park 
(JDWNP) extends into the northern part of the Dzongkhag covering four Gewogs.

Although the mean annual household income and the general literacy rate in the 
Dzongkhag is lower than the national average, poverty and unemployment rates 
are above the average. The 2010 GNH Index reports Wangduephodrang to be in 
medium happiness category with a value of 0.737.

Rice farming or Chuzhing (irrigated paddy field) is the predominant agricultural 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

activity in the Gewogs of lower altitude, followed by Kamzhing (dry land), and mixed 
farming and a few patches of Tseri (slash and burn) cultivation are also practiced. For 
the Gewogs in the higher altitudes, livestock farming is the predominant occupation. 

Paddy fields are mostly along the Dangchhu and Punatsangchhu, with double 
cropping of rice as an important agricultural feature. Potato is an important 
cash crop for the Gewogs of Phobji, Gangtey and Sephu and there is increasing 
citrus production in the Gewogs of Daga, Bjena, Phangyul and Rubeisa and ginger 
production in Daga and Athang Gewogs as a source of income generation. The 
lower valley towards the southern belt is best suited for sub-tropical horticulture 
crops such as oranges, mangoes, pineapples, guavas etc.

The one key priority for the government and the Dzongkhag in the Eleventh Plan will be to 
reconstruct the historic 374 years old Wangduephodrang Dzong, founded by Zhabdrung 
Ngawang Namgyal in 1638 and which was destroyed by fire on 24th June 2012.

6.2.19.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

Its location as well as the existence of many historical monuments and heritage 
structures such as Lhakhangs, Goenpas and other religious sites, the popular annual 
black neck crane festival, and other local events provide great opportunities for 
tourism development. Its scenic valley and pleasant climate in the spring, autumn 
and winter are added attractions.

With rich agricultural land and favorable climatic conditions, most Gewogs have 
potential for increased and diversified agriculture production. It has good internal 
road network with all of its Gewogs connected by farm and feeder roads which 
provide relatively easy accessibility to the markets. 

The construction of the 1200 MW Punatsangchhu-I Hydroelectricity Project & 
1020 MW Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectricity Project has contributed not only to 
employment generation but also served as market for livestock and agricultural 
produce for the farmers of the Dzongkhag and well as for the service industry of 
hotels, restaurants, mechanical workshops and recreation, etc. The commissioning of 
these projects in 2017-18 will enhance electricity supply reliability in the Dzongkhag 
providing additional opportunities for establishment of small and medium industries. 

While agricultural opportunities exists, the Dzongkhag is also confronted with the 
challenge of human wild life conflict, loss of agricultural land to urbanization, and 
small and fragmented land holdings. Addressing these challenges in the Eleventh 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Plan will be critical.

Moreover, despite the developments that have taken place, some pockets of 
poverty exist in the Dzongkhag such as Athang Gewog. Under REAP I support was 
provided to Lopokha village under Athang Gewog in the Tenth Plan. 

6.2.19.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity, ii) development of tourism and 
small and medium industries, and iii) targeted poverty intervention programme.

Enhancing agriculture and livestock productivity - Given the Dzongkhag’s high potential 
for increased and diversified agricultural production, agriculture will be promoted by 
addressing issues of human wildlife conflict, farm labour shortages, water shortages, and 
storage and marketing facilities. Production of cash crop will also be increased through 
training of farmers, encouraging the establishment of rural agro-based enterprises 
and cooperatives, and promoting better farming techniques and practices. Livestock 
productivity will be further expanded by introduction of improved and increased access 
to programmes on breeding, feed and fodder, and animal health. Sustainable utilization 
of pasture resources will be encouraged and supported. Trainings and education activities 
will be implemented for farmers, and farmers’ groups will be initiated, encouraged and 
supported in all aspects of livestock production, processing and marketing.

Promoting Tourism - The Dzongkhag with its scenic valleys, varied flora and fauna 
with winter roosting place for endangered black-necked cranes has potential for 
increased product diversification in the tourism industry. Various trekking routes will 
be promoted as well as support initiated for reviving local festivals in the villages. Eco-
tourism related activities in the Gewogs which fall within the JDWNP will be explored. 
In addition to cultural tourism, adventure tourism such as bicycling, kayaking and 
rafting will also be explored to diversify tourism activities in the Dzongkhag.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, six villages namely Beldro, 
Sili, Lamga, Thaphu, Lawa and Dahi will be supported under REAP Phase II. 
Income generating sustainable livelihood activities, capacity development and 
establishment of self-help groups/cooperatives will be some of the interventions 
at village level and additional support at household levels will be provided to 
the poorest households within the village.The funds for this programme will be 
directly provided from the centre.

6.2.20 Zhemgang Dzongkhag

Zhemgang Dzongkhag lies in the south-central region of the country and is bordered 
by the districts of Bumthang, Trongsa, Monggar, Sarpang and Trashigang to the 
North, West and East and the Indian State of Assam in the South. The Dzongkhag is 
a part of the wildlife corridor constituting the famous Royal Manas National Park, 
the Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, and Thrumshingla National Park. 

The Dzongkhag is supported by a Dungkhag in Panbang and eight Gewogs namely 
Bardo, Bjoka, Goshing, Nangkor, Ngangla, Phangkhar, Shingkhar and Trong. 
Zhemgang is considered as one of the most inaccessible Dzongkhags in the country. 
The Dzongkhag is divided into three agro-ecological zones-upper Kheng covering 
Bardo and Shingkhar with high altitude areas, middle Kheng covering Nangkhor and 
Trong with middle altitude areas and lower Kheng covering Phangkhar, Goshing, 
Nangla and Bjoka with mid-low altitude areas.

The Dzongkhag remains one of the most inaccessible and remote regions in the 
country. It has one of the highest levels of poverty incidence in the country and 
remains among the most vulnerable districts in terms of food security due to geo-



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

physical constraints, poor physical infrastructure and weak road access. However, 
the district enjoys reasonably moderate levels of human development linked to the 
acceptable levels of education and health facilities. The 2010 GNH Index reports 
Zhemgang to be in medium happiness category with a value of 0.753. 

Agriculture, horticulture, livestock, weaving and handicrafts, particularly bamboo 
products, are the main source of livelihood. Paddy, maize, mandarin and vegetables 
are some of the major crops grown in the Dzongkhag.

Works related to the construction of 56 kms Panbang-Nganglam highway, 44 kms 
Gomphu – Panbang highway, 18 kms Manmung – Digala highway and improvement 
of the Tingtibi- Praling highway are ongoing. Upon completion of these roads in 
the Eleventh Plan, accessibility and remoteness will be addressed to a large extent.

6.2.20.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

The planned development of 770 MW Chamkharchhu Hydroelectric project during 
the Eleventh Plan have potential to create new economic opportunities in terms 
of market for farmers to supply their agricultural and livestock products, local 
business, employment opportunities etc which will contribute towards improving 
the livelihood of the people. It gives the Dzongkhag Administration, the project 
authorities and the concerned central agencies an opportunity to collaborate and 
facilitate in harnessing new business and income generation opportunities from 
the mega projects. The enhanced electricity supply reliability will be used to 
develop small and medium industries in the Dzongkhag, particularly agro based 
and cane and bamboo products. 

Zhemgang also has the potential to become Bhutan’s centre for bird watching and 
to offer special bird watching treks, e.g. Yebilapcha – Tshangla Dzong – Subrang – 
Zhurphe - Gongphu road head; 5 days with Rufous necked hornbill, Blythe kingfisher, 
Green cochooa, Purple cochooa, Chestnut breasted partridge and many other 
common species found along the route. Other great treks could lead from Zhemgang 
to Manas (8 days), or from Gonphu via Bjoku back to Gonphu (16 days); both with high 
bird watching potential as well as potential for a lot of other animals and beautiful 
waterfalls. There is also good potential for handicraft tourism as people of Kheng 
Zurphel are skilled artisans who make earthen wares for cooking food and distilling 
alcohol. Besides, Zhemgang also has high potential for adventure sports such as 
rafting, fly fishing, trekking, etc. Further, with the completion of the construction of 
some of the ongoing roads, accessibility will no longer be an issue.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Zhemgang is also well known for production of bamboo and cane handicraft 
products (approximately 30 items) and many of the rural communities depend 
on the craft for their livelihood. Therefore, in an effort to facilitate integrated and 
organized production of bamboo and cane products, the Agency for Promotion of 
Indigenous Craft (APIC) in collaboration with relevant stakeholders will pilot a cane 
and bamboo cluster in remote Kheng, Bjokha. This will provide opportunity for 
upscaling production for possible exports in the future. 

With the completion of new roads and highways, access to the Dzongkhag will 
be improved thereby creating potential for enhancing agriculture, horticulture 
and livestock. However, issues such as water shortage/irrigation, human wildlife 
conflict, storage and marketing facilities are some of the challenges that must be 
addressed. 

6.2.20.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Plan objective of “Self-reliance and Inclusive Green Socio-
economic Development”, the key strategies the Dzongkhag will focus on, are i) 
targeted poverty intervention programme, ii) development of tourism and small 
and medium industries, and iii) enhancing agricultural and livestock productivity.

Under the targeted poverty reduction interventions, eight villages namely 
Dali, Ponchula, Namergang, Bangsikhar, Barpong, Zarkabla, Chapdhempaa and 
Khushibi will be supported through REAP Phase II. Income generating sustainable 
livelihood activities, capacity development and establishment of self-help groups/
cooperatives will be some of the interventions at village level and additional 
support at household levels will be provided to the poorest households within the 
village. The funds for this programme will be directly provided from the centre. 

Given the potential for tourism development in the Dzongkhag, the Dzongkhag 
Administration in collaboration with the Tourism Council of Bhutan and the 
communities will accelerate development of new tourism products unique to the 
Dzongkhag and facilitate establishment of appropriate tourism infrastructure and 
facilities. Eco and community based tourism, particularly in terms of community 
lodges, farm houses, camp sites etc, will be encouraged and developed to ensure 
that the benefits of tourism trickle down to the communities. 

The Dzongkhag will work closely with Agency for Promotion of Indigenous 
Products (APIC) to develop bamboo and cane products on a sustainable basis in 
the Dzongkhag through training, new product development, quality assurance, 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

raw material availability and exploring markets. The Dzongkhag will also explore 
possibilities of establishing small and medium industries based on these products 
to enhance household income and generate employment.

Enhancing Agriculture and Livestock productivity – with the construction of 
770 MW Chamkharchhu Hydroelectric project is scheduled to start during the 
Eleventh Plan for which, institutional arrangements will be made to facilitate 
supply of agricultural and livestock products to the project by the local farmers 
and communities. In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest, 
the Dzongkhag Administration will address issues of water shortage/irrigation, 
human wildlife conflict, storage and marketing facilities, to enhance agriculture 
and livestock production in the Dzongkhag.

6.3.1 Gelephu Thromde

Gelephu Thromde is located in the south central foothills of the country bordering 
the Indian state of Assam. It has six demkhongs with a population of 13,615 and 
an area of 11.52 sq km. Gelephu is a fast growing town with annual growth rate of 
5.5 percent. It is the gateway to the Indian markets for the six central Dzongkhags. 
Gelephu is accessible both by road and air, though air connectivity at present is 
limited to charter flights only. 

In line with the Local Government Act 2009, Gelephu Thromde is a self-governing 
municipality with an elected Mayor, Thromde Thuemis and a Thromde Council in

Gelephu has the third highest population among the four Thromdes. It is the main 
commercial hub for the six central Dzongkhags. The Central Regional Referral 
Hospital is located at Gelephu.

6.3.1.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

The vast amount of flat land, accessibility by land and air, development of Jigmeling 
industrial estate, proposal to establish railway links and dry port in Gelephu provides 
opportunities to develop the town as one of the major industrial hubs of the country. 

Gelephu is also rich in agricultural production of rice, mandarin, areca nuts, 
cardamom, tropical fruits and vegetable, some of which are exported to Bangladesh 
and India. Besides, mineral reserves such as high grade limestone, tungsten ore and 
dolomite are found in Gelephu. Other opportunities include proximity to the Manas 



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Wildlife National Park, fishing particularly mashee and the popular hot spring. 

Gelephu therefore has lot of economic opportunities as a result of which the town 
is growing at a rapid rate. The increasing rate of population is putting tremendous 
lot of pressure on existing urban infrastructure facilities. The issues of shortage 
of drinking water supply, solid waste management, unplanned development of 
periphery areas and safety are major challenges. In addition, instances of flash 
floods during the monsoon occur frequently causing extensive damage to both 
public and private properties. 

6.3.1.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Eleventh Plan objective of ‘Self-reliance and Inclusive 
Green Socio-Economic Development’, Gelephu Thromde will aim to develop an 
economically vibrant, ecologically sustainable and energy efficient town, the 
objective of the Thromde is to make Gelephu Town a ‘Clean, Green and Livable 
Town’. 

The strategies towards this are: 

• Gelephu Thromde will prepare and finalize four local area plans to prevent 
unplanned development of the town. 
• To address the perennial problem of water shortage, Gelephu Thromde will 
construct bore wells and water reservoir. To avoid wastage and maximize 
utilization, existing water supply schemes will be improved. 
• The problem of flash flood will be addressed through river training works 
at Shetikhari/Aipole.
• Thromde will construct Thromde office, and develop recreational facilities 
such as sports field, parks and community centres to enhance good 
governance and community vitality. 
• The Thromde will construct urban roads, footpaths, parking, waste and 
sewerage management system, bus terminal, storm water drainage etc. 
• To improve safety and security, street lights and CCTVs will be installed and 
maintained.
• To improve quality, adequacy and effectiveness of education and learning 
and improve students’ intake, existing school infrastructures, facilities and 
capacity will be improved and new infrastructures and additional capacity 
will be built and strengthened.

With some of the large mineral, metal and wood based industries located in 
Pasakha, Phuentsholing is one of the major industrial hubs of the country. It is 
also a major trading hub due to its close proximity to the Indian towns of Siliguri 
and Jaigoan. The town also has a well established network of financial and social 
institutions,business enterprises, whole sale traders, training institutions and 
college of science and technology attracting people, goods and services. 

There are two industrial estates in Phuentsholing. The Phuentsholing Industrial 
Estate has an area of 61 acres, including one acre near Doti khola, and houses 
more than 15 industrial sheds. The Pasakha Industrial Estate is located 16 km east 
of Phuentsholing in an area of 267 acres. The industrial estate is connected with all 
facilities like road network, water supply, power and transmission lines, drainage 
systems, telecommunication facilities and estate management office.

6.3.2.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges 

Phuentsholing is a major industrial and trading hub of the country. The opportunities 
offered by Phuentsholing are expected to be further enhanced with a number 
of new activities planned in the coming years. The major activities include the 
completion of Samtse-Phuentsholing highway; establishment of a mini Dry Port, 
Warehousing & Distribution Complex in Phuntsholing; construction of three new 
mega hydroelectricity projects viz. 180 MW Bunakha Hydroelectric project, 540 
MW Ammochhu Hydroelectric project, and 570 MW Wangchu Hydroelectric 
project, and Amochu land reclamation project. 

While such developments are received positively, the major challenge for the 
Thromde is the capacity and the resources to provide basic planned urban 
facilities and services to the rapidly growing urban population. After Thimphu, 
Phuentsholing receives the highest number of inward migration as a result of 
which the town is growing at the rate of 3 percent per annum. Already, the existing 
urban infrastructure facilities and services are under tremendous pressure. The 
issues of housing shortage, lack of clean and reliable drinking water, solid waste 
management problems, traffic congestion, environmental issues, security and 
safety issues, and poor urban infrastructure are major concerns. Some of the 
Phuentsholing residents are forced to live across the border due to housing 
shortages. 

6.3.2.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Eleventh Plan objective of ‘Self-reliance and Inclusive Green 
Socio-Economic Development’, Phuentsholing Thromde will aim to develop an 
economically vibrant, ecologically sustainable and energy efficient town, the 
objective of the Thromde is to make Phuentsholing Town a ‘Clean, Green and 
Livable Town’. 

The strategies towards this are: 

• Phuentsholing Thromde will prepare and finalize local area plans for 
Pekarshing, Malbasy and Gurungdara to ensure planned and sustainable 
development of these areas. 
• The shortage of drinking water will be addressed by exploring and 
constructing bore wells, ground-water, and reservoir schemes. Sewerage 
and waste management system will be constructed and improved. 




Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

• Thromde will construct Thromde office, and construct new urban roads 
in Kabreytar, Pasakha, Pekarshing, Damdara, Core area, implement 
Rinchending LAPs, and motor able bridge over Omchhu. 
• To enhance safety, promote community vitality and make Phuentsholing 
a highly livable town, street lights, CCTVs, bicycle paths, footpaths, 
recreational parks and sports facilities will be constructed. 
• To address the issues of housing shortage, National Housing Development 
Corporation in close collaboration with the Dzongkhag and Thromde will 
construct an additional 250-300 housing units over the next five years. 
• To improve quality, adequacy and effectiveness of education and learning 
and improve students’ intake, existing school infrastructures, facilities and 
capacity will be improved and new infrastructures and additional capacity 
will be built and strengthened.

Thimphu is the headquarters for the central government administration and also 
for number of corporate bodies. It also hosts the national referral hospital and a 
number of educational institutions, including the only private college. As a result, 
Thimphu Throm attracts lot of people from other Dzongkhags for number of 
reasons such as business, health and education services, family and many come 
in search of better life and jobs. Bhutan National Urbanization Strategy estimates 
that Thimphu grew at a rate of 12.6 percent during 2000-2005. 

6.3.4.2 Key Opportunities/Challenges

Being the capital city, Thimphu has better urban infrastructure facilities and 
services compared to the other Thromdes. However, the existing infrastructure 
facilities and services have not been able to keep pace with the rapid growth of 
the city. This has resulted in unplanned development in peripheral areas, chronic 
shortage of housing, lack of clean and reliable drinking water, issues of solid waste 
management, traffic congestion and pollution, and increasing issues of crime and 
safety. 

06

LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANS



Eleventh Five Year Plan - Main Document Volume I

Improving the existing infrastructures and facilities, and expanding and building 
additional and quality infrastructures and service facilities have become important 
and urgent. 

6.3.4.3 Strategies

In keeping with the Eleventh Plan objective of ‘Self-reliance and Inclusive 
Green Socio-Economic Development’, Thimphu Thromde will aim to develop 
an economically vibrant, ecologically sustainable and energy efficient city, the 
objective of the Thromde is to make Thimphu City a ‘Clean, Green and Livable City’. 

The strategies towards this are:

• Preparation and implementation of local area plans will be a priority. 
Accordingly, local area plans for Simtokha E4 area and Traditional Village 
will be prepared and local area plans for Taba, Jongshina, Samtenling, E4

implemented.
• In an effort to promote “Green Thimphu”, bicycle lanes will be constructed, 
eco-friendly Rapid Bus Transits System will be introduced, jogging path will 
be developed within the Thromde and trees/flowers will be planted. 
• Thromde will construct Thromde office, and address water shortage by 
constructing new water treatment plants, water reservoir, strengthening 
water utilization and management practices. 
• To enhance livability and safety, urban infrastructure facilities such as roads, 
waste management and sewerage system, drainage, landfill, bicycle paths, 
footpaths, street lights etc will be constructed and improved. Recreational 
and learning facilities such as parks, public library, wi-fi internet in hot spots 
will be developed.
• To improve quality, adequacy and effectiveness of education and learning 
and improve students’ intake, existing school infrastructures, facilities and 
capacity will be improved and new infrastructures and additional capacity 
will be built and strengthened.

Introduction
1. In General Assembly resolution 70/1, “Transforming our world: the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development”, a new, ambitious and universal development
agenda is outlined for the global community. The implementation of that bold and
transformative plan of action over the next 15 years could shift the world onto a
sustainable and resilient path, leaving no one behind.
2. In order to promote accountability to their citizens, Member States committed
to providing for systematic follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030
Agenda at the national, regional and global levels (see General Assembly resolution
70/1, para. 47). The high-level political forum on sustainable development was
mandated to play the central role in overseeing follow-up and review processes at
the global level. A key component of the process is an annual progress report,
prepared by the Secretary-General in cooperation with the United Nations system
(ibid., para. 83), which will inform the follow-up and review in the context of the
high-level political forum. The progress report is to be based on a proposed global
indicator framework developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on
Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (see E/CN.3/2016/2/Rev.1, annex IV),
which was agreed to, as a practical starting point, at the forty-seventh session of the
Statistical Commission, held in March 2016 (see E/2016/24, chap. I, sect. B,
decision 47/101).
3. The present report, as mandated, presents the first overview of the current
global situation relative to the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda, on the basis of the
global indicators. Some targets are not reflected at this initial stage, owing to a lack
of data, or because they are measured by indicators that are still undergoing
methodological development (see also sect. IV of the report). For most indicators
presented in the report, values represent regional and/or subregional aggregates (see
also para. 139 of the report). They are calculated from national data collected by
international agencies, based on their respective mandates and specialized expertise,
from national statistical systems.
1 The national data are often adjusted for international
comparability and, where lacking, estimations are made by international agencies.
4. The report comprises three sections that discuss global issues relative to the
Sustainable Development Goals. Section II summarizes the regional and global
status and trends for each Goal, based on selected indicators for which data are
available. Following the main theme of the 2016 session of the high-level political
forum, section III highlights some of the inequalities found across Goals and targets,
based on existing disaggregated data. Section IV details the availability and
compilation of data used to measure the global indicators. It also describes the
challenges faced by national statistical offices and the international sta tistical
community in producing the indicators for the Goals, as well as global initiatives
under way to address those challenges. 2

II. Measuring progress towards the Sustainable
Development Goals
Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere
5. Goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. It also aims
to ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access to basic
services and support people harmed by climate-related extreme events and other
economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.
6. The international poverty line is currently defined at $1.90 or below per
person per day using 2011 United States dollars purchasing power parity (ppp).3
In
the decade beginning in 2002, the proportion of the world’s population living below
the poverty line dropped by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If growth rates
during those 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate
will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth benefits all income
groups of the population equally. However, if the growth rates over the longer
period of 20 years prevail, the global poverty rate will likely be around 6 per cent.
In other words, eliminating extreme poverty will require a significant change from
historical growth rates.
7. In 2015, 10.2 per cent of the world’s workers were living with their families
on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. Young people
are especially likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed
youth aged 15 to 24 were considered working poor, compared to 9 per cent of
adults.
8. Expanding social protection programmes and targeting appropriate schemes to
the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty. Social protection
programmes include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding and
targeted food assistance, as well as social insurance and labour market programmes,
including old-age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills
training and wage subsidies, among others.
9. Social protections have expanded globally since 2000, as many developing
countries adopted policies that afford protection for multiple contingencies. Pension
coverage in particular is expanding rapidly. Over half (51 per cent) of people above
retirement age received a pension according to data available for the period from
2010 to 2012. Almost all countries have child or maternity benefit programmes, and
cash transfer schemes are increasing.
10. Despite progress over the past decade, increasing social protection for those
most in need remains a priority. Globally, 18,000 children still die each day from
poverty-related causes, and only 28 per cent of employed women are effectively
protected through contributory and non-contributory maternity cash benefits. Most
poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low-income
countries. Of the entire population, only 1 out of 5 receive any type of social
protection in low-income countries, compared with 2 out of 3 in upper-middleincome
countries. The coverage gap is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa and
Southern Asia, where most of the world’s poorest people live. In sub-Saharan

E/2016/75
4/28 16-09102
Africa, only 15 per cent of those in the bottom income quintile have access to a
social protection benefit.
11. Disaster risk reduction is essential to ending poverty and fostering sustainable
development. Disaster risk is disproportionally higher in poorer countries with
weaker institutions. In low- and lower-middle-income countries experiencing rapid
economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is increasing
at a faster pace than that at which risk-reducing capacities are being strengthened,
leading to increased disaster risk.
12. Economic losses from internationally reported disasters, principally large -
scale disasters, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching an estimated annual
average of $200 billion in 2013. Reported damage to housing, schools and healthcare
facilities, along with agricultural production, shows statistically significant
upward trends from 1990 onwards.
Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote
sustainable agriculture
13. Goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. It also
commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the
year. This will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural
practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international
cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural
productivity.
14. The fight against hunger has progressed over the past 15 years. Globally, the
prevalence of hunger has declined, from 15 per cent according to figures for 2000 to
2002, to 11 per cent according to figures for 2014 to 2016. However, more than 790
million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary
energy. If current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largel y missed by
2030. Many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the Millennium
Development Goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,
have faced natural and human-induced disasters or political instability, resulting in
protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large
parts of the population. The persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of
food availability. More and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of
progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition.
15. Globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total
of 159 million children, had stunted growth. Stunting is defined as inadequate
height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection.
Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of the children
under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. Another aspect of child malnutrition is the
growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every
region. Globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age
of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent.
16. Ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production
systems and resilient agricultural practices. Genetic diversity in livestock breeds is
crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm
animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products
and services. Globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds 
E/2016/75
16-09102 5/28
reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. Another 16 per cent of breeds
are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack
of data. The figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct.
17. To increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed,
both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. However, recent trends
in government spending are not favourable. The agriculture orientation index,
defined as agriculture’s share of government expenditures divided by the sector’s
share of gross domestic product (GDP), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between
2001 and 2013. The decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the
food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural
spending.
18. Since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in
developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share
of sector-allocable aid from member countries of the Development Assistance
Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD). This has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid-1980s, as a
result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social
capital and bolstering fragile States.
19. One of the targets for Goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in
world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural
export subsidies. Those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and
can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. That
said, some progress is being made, with members of the World Trade Organization
adopting a ministerial decision, in December 2015, on eliminating export subsidies
for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent
effect.
Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
20. Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life. The
Goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and
child health; communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases;
universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and
affordable medicines and vaccines. It also calls for more research and development,
increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk
reduction and management.
21. Between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated
ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. Almost all maternal deaths occur in
low-resource settings and can be prevented. Globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted
by skilled health-care personnel in 2015. Under-five mortality rates fell rapidly
from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. Nevertheless, an estimated
5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under-five
mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate, that is, the
likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000
live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. Over that period,
progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced
advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a
larger share (45 per cent) of all under-five deaths. 
E/2016/75
6/28 16-09102
22. Preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing
through universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services are critical
to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. Worldwide, in
2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who
were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern
contraceptive methods; in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, however, the share was
less than half. Childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all
regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls
aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in Eastern Asia to 102 births per
1,000 girls in sub-Saharan Africa.
23. The incidence of major infectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and
malaria, has declined globally since 2000. Globally in 2015, the number of new HIV
infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people;
2.1 million people became newly infected that year. The incidence of HIV was
highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. In
2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were
reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in South-Eastern Asia and the Western
Pacific. Almost half the world’s population is at risk of malaria and, in 2015, the
incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1,000 people at risk, an estimated total of 214
million cases. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases
worldwide, with an incidence rate of 235 cases per 1,000 people at risk. In 2014, at
least 1.7 billion people, in 185 countries, required treatment for at least one
neglected tropical disease.4
24. According to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year,
accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to
non-communicable diseases. Of all deaths among persons under the age of 70,
commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result
of non-communicable diseases. Over three quarters of premature deaths were caused
by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease.
Globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of
non-communicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012.
Reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing
premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third. In 2015, over
1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female
(180 million) smokers.
25. Unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both
non-communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong
integrated nature of the Goals. In 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from
infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by
inadequate hand-washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non-existent
sanitation services. In 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some
6.5 million deaths.
26. Substance use and substance-use disorders have also created a significant
public health burden. Worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was
estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with
__________________

The term refers to a diverse group of infections that are common among poor and marginalized
populations but have not attracted the same treatment and research funding as HIV, tuberculosis
and malaria.
E/2016/75
16-09102 7/28
wide variations across countries. Alcohol consumption was highest in the developed
regions (10.4l per person) and lowest in Northern Africa (0.5l per person). In 2013,
only about 1 in 6 people worldwide suffering from drug-use disorders received
treatment. Approximately 1 in 18 people with drug-use disorders received treatment
in Africa that year, compared with 1 in 5 in Western and Central Europe.
27. Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures. The most common are
anxiety and depression, which, not infrequently, can lead to suicide. In 2012, an
estimated 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide, and 86 per cent of them
were under the age of 70. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death
among those between the ages of 15 and 29.
28. Around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013. Halving
the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an
ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles, which nearly
doubled between 2000 and 2013.
29. Total official flows from all providers for medical research and basic health
sectors were $8.9 billion in 2014. Within this total, official development assistance
(ODA) from DAC donors was $4.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 20 per cent in real
terms since 2010, with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. In 2014,
$1 billion was spent on malaria control and $1.2 billion was spent on other
infectious diseases, excluding AIDS.
Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
opportunities for all
30. Despite progress, the world failed to meet the Millennium Development Goal
of achieving universal primary education by 2015. In 2013, the latest year for which
data are available, 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school.
Estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had
dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out-of-school children will
never set foot in a classroom. The Sustainable Development Goals clearly recognize
that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly
addresses the challenges of quality and equity.
31. Measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to
identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to
formulate appropriate remedial action. For example, data for 2013 from 15 Latin
American countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third
graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries,
fewer than half were proficient in reading.
32. At the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to
understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. However, in 2014, between
40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve even minimum levels of
proficiency in reading, in 10 African countries, and in nine of those countries,
between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve minimum levels of
proficiency in mathematics.
E/2016/75
8/28 16-09102
33. The end of lower secondary education 5
often coincides with the end of
compulsory education. By this stage, young people should be able to master subjectrelated
knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. Data from
38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries,
at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in
reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in
developing regions, for which data were available.
34. Completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been
rising steadily since 2000. Completion rates for primary education in both
developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. At the lower
secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed
substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for
developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions).
35. Quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language
skills and fosters emotional development. In the majority of the 58 countries with
available data for the period 2009-2015, more than half of children between the ages
of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains:
literacy, numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and
learning.
36. Goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. Worldwide, in
2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to
read and write were women. Globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school,
compared to 1 in 12 boys. Children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are
nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. Out-ofschool
rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households
headed by someone with less than a primary education.
37. To fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new
primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for
nearly 26 million of them by 2030. Africa faces the greatest challenges in this
regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained
primary school teachers. In 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub-Saharan Africa
and 84 per cent in Northern Africa were trained in accordance with national
standards.
38. Official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to
around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. It totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with
Australia, France and Japan being the largest contributors.
Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
39. Gender equality and women’s empowerment have advanced in recent decades.
Girls’ access to education has improved, the rate of child marriage declined and
progress was made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive
rights, including fewer maternal deaths. Nevertheless, gender equality remains a
persistent challenge for countries worldwide and the lack of such equality is a major
obstacle to sustainable development.

16-09102 9/28
40. Assuring women’s rights through legal frameworks is a first step in addressing
discrimination against them. As of 2014, 143 countries guaranteed equality between
men and women in their constitutions; another 52 countries have yet to make this
important commitment. In 132 countries, the statutory legal age of marriage is equal
for women and men, while in another 63 countries, the legal age of marriage is
lower for women than for men.
41. Violence against women and girls violates their human rights and hinders
development. Most such violence is perpetrated by intimate partners, with available
data from surveys conducted between 2005 and 2015, in 52 countries, (including
only one country from the developed regions) indicating that 21 per cent of girls and
women aged between 15 and 49 experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the
hands of an intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Estimates on the risks of
violence experienced by women with disabilities, women from ethnic minorities and
among women above the age of 50 are not yet included, owing to data limitations.
Additionally, human trafficking disproportionately affects women and girls, since
70 per cent of all victims detected worldwide are female.
42. Globally, the proportion of women aged between 20 and 24 who reported that
they were married before their eighteenth birthday dropped from 32 per cent around
1990 to 26 per cent around 2015. Child marriage is most commo n in Southern Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa, with 44 per cent of women married before their eighteenth
birthday in Southern Asia and 37 per cent of women married before their eighteenth
birthday in sub-Saharan Africa. The marriage of girls under the age 15 is also
highest in those two regions, at 16 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Social
norms can and do change, however, with the rate of marriage of girls under the age
of 15 declining globally from 12 per cent around 1990 to 7 per cent around 2015,
although disparities are found across regions and countries. The most rapid
reduction in child marriage overall was recorded in Northern Africa, where the
percentage of women married before the age of 18 dropped by more than half, from
29 per cent to 13 per cent, over the past 25 years.
43. The harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting is another human
rights violation that affects girls and women worldwide. While the exact number of
girls and women globally who have undergone the procedure is unknown, at least
200 million have been subjected to the procedure in 30 countries with representative
prevalence data. Overall, rates of female genital mutilation/cutting have been
declining over the past three decades. However, not all countries have made
progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. Today, in the 30 countries, for
which data were available, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the
practice, versus 1 in 2 in the mid-1980s.
44. In every region, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid work, including
caregiving and such household tasks as cooking and cleaning. On average, women
report that they spend 19 per cent of their time each day in unpaid activities, versus
8 per cent for men. The responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work,
combined with paid work, means greater total work burdens for women and girls
and less time for rest, self-care, learning and other activities.
45. Globally, women’s participation in parliament rose to 23 per cent in 2016,
representing an increase by 6 percentage points over a decade. Slow progress in this
area is in contrast with more women in parliamentary leadership positions. In 2016,
the number of women speakers of national parliaments jumped from 43 to 49 (out of 
E/2016/75
10/28 16-09102
the 273 posts globally); women accounted for 18 per cent of all speakers of
parliament in January 2016.
Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
for all
46. Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to
the survival of people and the planet. Goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating
to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of
water resources worldwide.
47. In 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility;
2.4 billion did not. Among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million
people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. In
2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities
compared to 59 per cent in 2000. Nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal
waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the
environment.
48. More progress has been made in access to drinking water. In 2015, 6.6 billion
people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water
source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. Despite that improvement, an estimated
663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year.
While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub-Saharan
Africa and Oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries.
Moreover, not all improved sources are safe. For instance, in 2012 it was estimated
that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated
with faecal matter.
49. Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of
“water stress”, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major
sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region.
Currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure
that is projected to rise. Already, water stress affects countries on every continent
and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social
development. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from
36 countries in 1998. Of those, 10 countries, on the Arabian Peninsula, in Central
Asia and in Northern Africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable
fresh water resources.
50. Integrated water resources management, one of the follow-up actions to the
Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development
(Johannesburg Plan of Implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. In
2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on
integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in
place at the national level.
51. Total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which
total aid flows from DAC donors amounted to $8 billion. Aid for water and
sanitation nearly doubled as a share of ODA during the International Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990). Since that time, on average, it has
remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. Better targeting and tracking of
water aid within the context of national situations is needed. For instance, numerous 
E/2016/75
16-09102 11/28
countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving
minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other
countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per
capita a year).
52. Effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation
of stakeholders. According to a 2013-2014 Global Analysis and Assessment of
Sanitation and Drinking-Water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed
reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or
policy. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus is being refined to also
include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next
cycle of Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water
monitoring.
Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
53. Energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the Sustainable Development
Goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health,
education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change.
54. The proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased
steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. Still, 1.1 billion people are
without this valuable service. Recent global progress in this area has been driven
largely by Asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of
demographic growth. Of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010,
80 per cent are urban dwellers.
55. The proportion of the world’s population with access to clean fuels and
technologies for cooking increased from 51 per cent in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2014,
although there has been limited progress since 2010. The absolute number of people
relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, such as solid fuels and
kerosene, however, has actually increased, reaching an estimated three billion
people. Limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population
growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas.
56. The share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid
biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the
world’s total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in
2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. More telling is the fact that modern renewable energy
consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew
rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for
60 per cent of all new power-generating capacity in 2014. In absolute terms, about
72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources
between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from Eastern Asia.
The technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and
solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern
renewable energy between 2010 and 2012.
57. Energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by GDP,
reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. Globally,
energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. This
represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it
decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. As a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 
E/2016/75
12/28 16-09102
6.7 (millijoules (mJ) per 2011 United States dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012.
The proportion of the world’s energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency
regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005
to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. Still, current progress is only about two thirds
of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
Among end-use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy
intensity, followed closely by transportation. About 68 per cent of the savings in
energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with
Eastern Asia as the largest contributor.
Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and
productive employment and decent work for all
58. Sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving
sustainable development. The global annual growth rate of real GDP per capita
increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per
cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). Developing regions grew far faster
than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent
and 1.4 per cent, respectively.
59. Labour productivity (measured by GDP per worker) spurs economic growth.
Growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed
regions, especially in Asia. Between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by
0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent
per year, on average, in Eastern Asia, the region with the fastest growth. Despite
rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in
the developed regions. In 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced
23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub-Saharan Africa (which has
the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an
average worker in Western Asia (which has the highest labour productivity in
developing regions).
60. The global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak
of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the
developed regions. Unemployment affects population groups differently. Globally,
women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men
and adults aged 25 and over. In all regions, except Eastern Asia and the developed
regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. In almost
all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults.
61. Although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by
one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of
child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. The
incidence of child labour was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 21 per cent of
children were employed as child labourers. Of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per
cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012.
62. While economic growth and employment are important for economic security,
access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. Between
2011 and 2014, the proportion of the world’s adult population with an account at a
financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent
to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this
period. Financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. The 
E/2016/75
16-09102 13/28
proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the
proportion of men who are account holders. Moreover, the proportion of account
holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower
than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households.
63. In 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120
per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. However, total commitments fell
slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion
drop in support for transport and storage. A total of 146 developing countries
received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower-middle-income countries
receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per
cent and upper-middle-income countries receiving 19 per cent. On a per capita
basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any
other income group and more than twice the global average.
Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable
industrialization and foster innovation
64. Goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development:
infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic
physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise.
Industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby
reduces income poverty. Innovation advances the technological capabilities of
industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills.
65. An important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air
travel. In 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions;
55 per cent originated from developed regions. However, in the least developed
countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, air
passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and
1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. Similar patterns are found for freight
volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing
countries and small island developing States made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent
and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014.
66. Manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and
social stability. In 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of GDP of
developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade
owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions. In contrast, the
share of manufacturing value added in GDP remained relatively stagnant for
developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in
2015. Those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added
contributing over 31 per cent to GDP in Eastern Asia and 10 per cent or less in both
sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. The least developed countries face particular
challenges in industrializing. Although those countries represent 13 per cent of the
global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value
added. Worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. While
manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have
steadily increased in developing countries. In the least developed countries,
agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment.
67. In developing countries, small-scale industries accounted for an estimated
15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total 
E/2016/75
14/28 16-09102
industrial employment in 2015. However, access to financial services in those
countries remains a problem. Globally, the credit gap for small and medium
enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at
$3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. In emerging markets, between 45 per cent and
55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by
financial services.
68. As the structure of world economies shifts to less energy-intensive industries
and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions
have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of GDP. Global carbon dioxide
emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013,
a decrease of about 30 per cent.
69. Innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred
by investments in research and development. Global expenditure on research and
development as a proportion of GDP stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. However, this
figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per
cent of GDP for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below
0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries.
The number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. While
the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged
from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in
developed regions.
70. Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached
$59.5 billion in 2014. The main sectors receiving assistance were transport and
energy.
71. Infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and
communications technology. Mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around
the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global
information society. By 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas
covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. In rural areas,
the share was only 29 per cent.
Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries
72. Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on
age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status
within a country. The Goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including
those related to representation, migration and development assistance.
73. Target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent
of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. This was
true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. However, this does
not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced
negative growth rates over that period.
74. The labour share of GDP, which represents the proportion of wages and social
protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary
income inequality. A shift of income away from labour towards capital has
contributed to rising inequality. Globally, the labour share of GDP decreased from
57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a 
E/2016/75
16-09102 15/28
decline in employers’ social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was
stable or slightly upward in developing regions.
75. Preferential treatment for developing countries and the least developed
countries in trade can help reduce inequalities by creating more export
opportunities. Major developed country markets already offer duty-free market
access to the least developed countries on most of their tariff lines. But even when
they do not, as in the case of some agricultural products, the average applied tariff
rate is often close to zero per cent. The share of exports from the least developed
countries and developing regions that benefitted from duty-free treatment increased
from 2000 to 2014, reaching 79 per cent for developing countries and 84 per cent
for the least developed countries. The comparative advantage of the least developed
countries in duty-free access varies depending on the product groups analysed.
Almost all agricultural products from the least developed countries (98 per cent)
were exempt from duties by developed countries, versus 74 per cent of products
from developing countries. Shares of exports exempt from duties diverged even
more for textiles and clothing: the rate for both product groups for the least
developed countries was around 70 per cent, while for developing countries it was
41 per cent for textiles and 34 per cent for clothing.
76. Official development assistance and financial flows contribute to reducing
inequalities within and among countries. In 2014, total resource flows for
development to the least developed countries totalled $55.2 billion, and eight donor
countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (GNI) for ODA to
the least developed countries. Preliminary ODA figures for 2015 show that bilateral
net ODA to the least developed countries increased by 4 per cent in real terms,
compared to 2014.
77. People migrate for many reasons, including better employment opportunities
and higher wages. When successful, many migrants send money back to their
country of origin to care of family members. Remittances to developing countries
have increased slightly, rising to $431.6 billion in 2015, up 0.4 per cent from 2014.
In contrast, global remittances (including those to developed countries) were
estimated at $582 billion in 2015, a decline of 1.7 per cent from 2014. Even with the
global contraction in remittance flows in 2015, the longer term trend is upward.
However, the cost of sending money across national borders is significant,
averaging 7.5 per cent of the amount remitted in 2015, down from 10 per cent in
2008 but still above the 3 per cent called for in target 10.c.
Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient
and sustainable
78. More than half the world’s population lives in cities. By 2030, it is projected
that 6 out of 10 people will be urban dwellers. Despite numerous planning
challenges, well-managed cities and other human settlements can be incubators for
innovation and ingenuity and key drivers of sustainable development.
79. However, as more people migrate to cities in search of a better life and urban
populations grow, housing issues intensify. Already in 2014, 30 per cent of the
urban population lived in slum-like conditions; in sub-Saharan Africa, the
proportion was 55 per cent, the highest of any region. Globally, more than 880
million people were living in slums in 2014. This estimate does not include people 
E/2016/75
16/28 16-09102
in inadequate or unaffordable housing (defined as costing more than 30 per cent of
total monthly household income).
80. As population growth outpaces available land, cities expand far beyond their
formal administrative boundaries. This urban sprawl can be seen in many cities
around the world, and not only in developing regions. From 2000 to 2015, the ratio
of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate in Eastern Asia and the
Oceania was the highest in the world, with developed regions second. Other regions,
such as South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, showed a
decrease in that indicator over the same time period. Unfortunately, a low value for
this ratio is not necessarily an indication that urban dwellers are faring well, as this
can indicate a prevalence of overcrowded slums. Unplanned urban sprawl
undermines other determinants of sustainable development. For example, for every
10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita carbon
dioxide emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution. This
illustrates the important interlinkages across the goals and targets.
81. Likewise, managing solid waste is often problematic in densely populated
areas. In fact, in many developing regions, less than half of solid waste is safely
disposed of. As per capita waste generation continues to rise, the collection and safe
disposal of solid waste will continue to require serious attention.
82. Urban air pollution also challenged cities around the world, causing illness and
millions of premature deaths annually. In 2014, around half the global urban
population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than
maximum standards set by the World Health Organization.
83. The quest for sustainable and coordinated urban development starts with
national policies and regional development plans. As of 2015, 142 countries had a
national urban policy in place or under development. Those countries are home to
75 per cent of the world’s urban population.
Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
84. Economic growth and development require the production of goods and
services that improve the quality of life. Sustainable growth and development
require minimizing the natural resources and toxic materials used, and the waste and
pollutants generated, throughout the entire production and consumption process.
85. Two measures, material footprint and domestic material consumption, provide
an accounting of global material extraction and use, as well as flows or consumption
of materials in countries. The material footprint reflects the amount of primary
materials required to meet a country’s needs. It is an indicator of the material
standard of living or level of capitalization of an economy. Domestic material
consumption measures the amount of natural resources used in economic processes.
86. In 2010, the total material footprint in developed regions was significantly
higher than that of developing regions, 23.6 kg per unit of GDP versus 14.5 kg per
unit of GDP, respectively. The material footprint of developing regions increased
from 2000 to 2010, with non-metallic minerals showing the largest increase.
87. Domestic material consumption in developed regions has diminished slightly,
from 17.5 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 15.3 tonnes per capita in 2010. It remains
significantly higher than the value for developing regions, which stood at 8.9 tonnes 
E/2016/75
16-09102 17/28
per capita in 2010. Domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all
developing regions from 2000 to 2010, except in Africa, where it remained
relatively stable (around 4 tonnes per capita), and Oceania, where it decreased from
around 10.7 to 7.7 tonnes per capita. The rise in domestic material consumption per
capita in Asia during that period is primarily a result of rapid industrialization.
88. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of
Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior
Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in
International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
established international frameworks to achieve the environmentally sound
management of hazardous wastes, chemicals and persistent organic pollutants. With
six exceptions, all Member States are party to at least one of those conventions. The
number of parties to those conventions rose significantly from 2005 to 2015,
particularly in Africa and Oceania. There are now 183 parties to the Basel
Convention, 180 to the Stockholm Convention and 155 to the Rotterdam
Convention.
Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
89. Climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its
widespread, unprecedented impacts disproportionately burden the poorest and most
vulnerable. Urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is
integral to the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
90. The global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation
in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing
sustainable low-carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of
global greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 April 2016, 175 Member States signed the
Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. The new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to
accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable lowcarbon
future.
91. Climate change often exacerbates disasters. Between 1990 and 2013, more
than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths
trending upwards. As a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to
implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. In 2015, 83 countries
had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk.
92. Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are
responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement
the agreement. As of 4 April 2016, 161 intended nationally determined
contributions, from 189 of the 197 Parties to the Framework Convention (the
European Commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had
been recorded by the secretariat of the Framework Convention, providing insights
into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into
national policies, strategies and planning. Among those countries, 137 parties
included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined
contributions. Some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate
change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development,
sustainability and security. In order to help countries move forward on climate
action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the Paris Agreement, 
E/2016/75
18/28 16-09102
to assess collective progress every five years. The process will begin in 2018, with a
facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions
and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions.
93. As parties scale up climate change action, enhanced cooperation, capacitybuilding
and access to financial and technical support will be needed to help many
countries realize their priorities, including those identified in intended nationally
determined contributions and national adaptation plans. Developed countries have
committed to mobilizing, by 2020, $100 billion a year in climate financing from a
wide variety of sources to help address the needs of developing countries. By 2025,
parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will set a
new collective goal of at least $100 billion per year. The Green Climate Fund, a
mechanism within the Framework Convention created to assist developing countries
in adaptation and mitigation practices, is an important delivery vehicle for this
financing. As of May 2016, the Green Climate Fund had mobilized $10.3 billion.
94. Climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and
populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island
developing States. The preparation of national adaptation programmes of action
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is helping the
least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from
the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Least Developed Countries Expert
Group. In addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action
will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive
national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind.
Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for
sustainable development
95. Oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in
human well-being and social and economic development worldwide. They are
particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per
cent of the global population in 2010. Oceans provide livelihoods and tourism
benefits, as well as subsistence and income. They also help regulate the global
ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. In fact, coastal and marine
resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year
through ecosystem services. However, those resources are extremely vulnerable to
environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. The
sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their
biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda, in particular for small
island developing States.
96. Pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. In addition,
since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of
hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their
source. In many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the
presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land,
causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental
changes. The five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication,
according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the 
E/2016/75
16-09102 19/28
Transboundary Water Assessment Programme, are the Bay of Bengal, the East
China Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Brazil Shelf and the South China Sea.
97. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about
one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the
full impact of climate change. However, this comes at a steep ecological price, as
dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the pH level of oceans, thereby
increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. Concerns
about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been
confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated.
98. Fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the
economy. However, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats.
Ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces
biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic
development. In order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained
within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can
produce maximum sustainable yields. Based on an analysis of assessed stocks, the
percentage of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. Fortunately, the downward
trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized since 2008.
99. Biodiverse marine sites require safeguarding to ensure sustainable long-term
use of their precious natural resources. Globally, in 2014, 8.4 per cent of the marine
environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and
0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under
protection. From 2000 to 2016, the share of marine sites around the world that are
designated as key biodiversity areas and are completely covered by protected areas
increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent.
Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land
degradation and halt biodiversity loss
100. Preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect,
restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other
ecosystems. Goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably, restoring
degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded
natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss.
101. Between 1990 and 2015, the world’s forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent
of the world’s total land mass to 30.7 per cent. The loss was mainly attributable to
the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure
development. Meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through
planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. Owing to the
balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of
forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million
hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015.
102. To safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity,
protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. In
2014, 15.2 per cent of the world’s terrestrial and freshwater environments were
covered by protected areas. The percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas 
E/2016/75
20/28 16-09102
covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per
cent in 2016. Over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas
that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of
mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to
20.1 per cent.
103. The focus in Goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time,
since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards
extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red
List Index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in Latin America and the
Caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous
wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. The greatest extinction risks for birds and
mammals are found in South-Eastern Asia, mainly owing to the conversion of
lowland forests. However, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for
vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing States (the
Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tonga) as a result of conservation
actions over the past several decades.
104. Conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of
wildlife. Since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected
in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to
grow. Comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000
transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per
year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. The value of
legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. For example, the value of
recorded seizures of Crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per
cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013,
with no clear trend discernible.
105. In 2014, bilateral ODA to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an
increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. The two largest recipients of
biodiversity assistance were the Philippines and India, which together rec eived
about $1 billion of the total aid.
Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development,
provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive
institutions at all levels
106. Peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the
core of sustainable development. Several regions have enjoyed increased and
sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still
face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a
result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other
fundamental freedoms.
107. The number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively
stable from 2008 to 2014. The worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide
was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight
decrease with respect to previous years. Yet during that period, the homicide rate in
developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the
least developed countries. Moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities
and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries,
causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs.
E/2016/75
16-09102 21/28
108. Various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline
that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In all but 7 of 73
countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of
children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological
aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In Northern Africa, the share was
more than 90 per cent.
109. Globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking
(21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. By 2014, the figures had
dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the
levels recorded for 2004.
110. Sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of children’s rights violations.
Yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full
extent of the problem. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries
suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced
sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from
zero to 16 per cent. Comparable data on the experiences of men are only available
for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the
same countries.
111. Progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed.
Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased
slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-
2014. However, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more
than two times that of developed regions. In Southern Asia, for instance, more than
2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014, despite some improvement
over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005.
112. Among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the
crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. The data suggest a
significant gap in citizens’ access to and trust in authorities. Although official data
on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the
rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who
had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions.
113. Registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the
law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. Despite recent
progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have
not been recorded. In sub-Saharan Africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have
not been registered by their fifth birthday. Globally, children living in urban areas
are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. In
most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per
cent of the population.
114. Efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more
effective, inclusive and transparent. Over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144
countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively
(where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). Voting rights
assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of
inclusivity at the international level. For example, while developing countries account
for 63 per cent of voting rights in the African Development Bank, this figure is only
35 per cent in the International Monetary Fund and 38 per cent in the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank Group. 
E/2016/75
22/28 16-09102
115. A free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of
human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. The number of journalists
killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013,
90 States had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information.
116. The proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has
doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. The share
of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris
Principles) (adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest
in developed regions (46 per cent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (41 per
cent).
Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global
Partnership for Sustainable Development
117. Achieving the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda requires a revitalized and
enhanced global partnership that brings together Governments, civil society, the
private sector, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizes all
available resources. 6 Enhancing support to developing countries, in particular the
least developed countries and the small island developing States, is fundamental to
equitable progress for all.
Finance
118. In 2015, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance
Committee of OECD totalled $131.6 billion. Taking account of inflation and the rise
in the value of the dollar in 2015, this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in
2014, and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from those
countries as a share of their gross national income was 0.30 per cent, on par with
2014. Most of the increase was owing to higher expenditures for costs associated
with refugees. However, even if those costs are excluded, ODA still rose by 1.7 per
cent. Seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of gross
national income in 2015: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
Information and communications technology
119. Fixed-broadband services remain largely unaffordable and unavailable across
much of the population in developing regions, highlighting digital divides in access
to high-speed, high-capacity Internet services. By 2015, fixed-broadband
penetration had reached 29 per cent in developed regions, but only 7.1 per cent and
0.5 per cent, respectively, in developing regions and the least developed countries.
Major disparities are also found in Internet use. In developing regions, one third of
the population is online versus 1 in 10 people in the least developed countries. Data
also reveal that more men than women are online. In 2015, globally, the Internet
user penetration rate was about 11 per cent lower for women than for men. The
gender gap is even higher in developing regions (15 per cent) and highest in the
least developed countries (29 per cent).

The report of the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development, as transmitted by a
note by the Secretary-General, can be seen as a complement to the overview of Goal 17 (see
E/FFDF/2016/2).
E/2016/75
16-09102 23/28
Capacity-building
120. Net ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $23 billion
in 2014; of that total, sub-Saharan Africa received $6 billion and Southern and
Central Asia received $4.6 billion. The main sectors receiving assistance were
public administration, environment and energy, which together were allocated a
total of $9.3 billion.
Trade
121. The weighted average of applied tariffs has been decreasing over time, but still
varies widely across regions and country groups on main product sectors. Average
agricultural tariffs on imports coming into Asia, for instance, are the highest in the
world, at around 27 per cent for Southern Asia and 20 per cent for Eastern Asia in
2015, under most-favoured nation status.
122. In 14 years, the least developed countries’ share in world merchandise exports
nearly doubled, from 0.6 per cent in 2000 to 1.1 per cent in 2014. The key driver of
export growth during that period was a massive rise in the price of fuel, ores and
metals, reflecting a high demand in developing countries, notably China. In
services, the least developed countries increased their share of world exports to 0.8
per cent in 2014 ($40 billion), up from 0.5 per cent in 2005.
Data, monitoring and accountability
123. The requirements of the indicators developed in the context of the Millennium
Development Goals have fostered stronger national statistical plans and systems.
The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions
between 2010 and 2015, including in sub-Saharan Africa and the least developed
countries. However, the overall number of plans declined from 56 to 54 among the
countries being observed, since the time period of some existing plans expired.
124. Financial support for statistical capacity amounted to $325 million in 2013,
compared with $379 million in 2010. However, assistance to the least developed
countries, in this regard, tripled during the period and reached $265 million. Despite
an increasing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence -based
policymaking and development, the share of ODA dedicated to statistics hovered at
around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.
125. Population and housing censuses are a primary source of the disaggregated
data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring development policies
and programmes. During the 10-year period spanning from 2006 to 2015, 90 per
cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and
housing census.
126. Over the period 2005-2014, birth registration data were available for 183 out
of 230 countries or areas, whereas death registration data were available for 157.
Only 58 per cent of developing countries with available data have birth registration
coverage of 90 per cent or more; 71 per cent of developing countries with available
data have death registration coverage of 75 per cent or more. Sub-Saharan Africa
has the lowest levels of complete birth and death registration. 
E/2016/75
24/28 16-09102
III. Ensuring that no one is left behind
127. In launching the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Member States
pledged to leave no one behind. They recognized that the dignity of the individual is
fundamental and that the Goals and targets should be met for all nations and peoples
and for all segments of society. Furthermore, they declared their endeavour to first
reach those who are furthest behind. Going beyond rhetoric in this regard, however,
is no simple matter. As a starting point, it requires an understanding of which
population groups are the most disadvantaged, in what way and to what extent. This
is only discovered through accurate information that is broken down by age, sex,
location of residence and other group characteristics. As stated in the 2030 Agenda:
“Quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data will be needed to help
with the measurement of progress and to ensure that no one is left behind. Such data
is key to decision-making” (see resolution 70/1, para. 48).
128. The data demands relating to the Sustainable Development Goals are
unprecedented, and will require coordinated efforts at the global, regional and
national levels. However, even from the data currently available, it is abundantly
clear that the benefits of development are not equally shared.
129. The world today is home to 1.8 billion people between the ages of 10 and 24.
Children and young people, who are potential agents of change and partners in
implementing the 2030 Agenda, face enormous challenges. About one tenth of the
child population aged between 5 and 17, with a total number estimated at 168
million, was engaged in child labour in 2012. In 2015, the youth unemployment rate
(among young people between the ages of 15 and 24) globally was 15 per cent,
more than three times the unemployment rate for adults (4.6 per cent). Moreover,
many of the job opportunities available to youth pay less than those avail able to
adults. Globally, while 9.3 per cent of adults were considered working poor in 2015,
15.5 per cent of all employed youth fell into that category.
130. Young people continue to be overrepresented among the direct and indirect
victims of violence. Some 200,000 homicides each year, 43 per cent of all
homicides globally, involve children and adults between the ages of 10 and 29.
Young males have the highest risk of becoming victims of homicide and the highest
rates, by far, of being suspected perpetrators of homicide. Children are also among
those most affected by human trafficking. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan
Africa, where 70 per cent of all trafficking victims were children in 2010 -2012. In
addition, young people aged between 15 and 24 accounted for an estimated 40 per
cent of all new HIV infections worldwide in 2011.
131. While severe income inequality is a challenge in and of itself, it can also affect
other aspects of sustainable development. For example, globally in 2015, births in
the richest 20 per cent of households were over two times more likely to be attended
by skilled health personnel than those in the poorest 20 per cent of households
(89 per cent versus 43 per cent). Survey data from 63 developing countries for
2008-2012 show that children from the poorest households are nearly four times
more likely to be out of school than their peers from the richest households. An
analysis of 87 countries with survey data from 2005-2014 suggests that children
from the poorest households are more than twice as likely to be stunted as their
richest peers. These differences, if not addressed, can perpetuate current inequalities
in income and other aspects of sustainable development. 
E/2016/75
16-09102 25/28
132. Health-care systems, for instance, tend to be weaker in rural and remote areas,
with lower rates of health service coverage than in urban centres. Rural populations
also carry a disproportionate burden of disease and death. Survey data from
59 developing countries between 2005 and 2013 show that children from rural areas
are 1.7 times more likely to die before the age of 5 as children from urban areas.
Significant disparities between rural and urban areas are also found in access to
drinking water. In 2015, globally, 96 per cent of the urban population had ac cess to
an improved water source, compared to 84 per cent of the rural population. The
differences are even more pronounced when looking at piped water. In 2015, 79 per
cent of the urban population globally had access to piped water in their homes or
premises, versus 33 per cent of the rural population.
133. Persistent inequalities are also found within groups of countries, particularly
those in special situations. The least developed countries, landlocked developing
countries and small island developing States, for example, all face unique
challenges that require focused attention. In 2015, while the prevalence of
undernourishment was 12.9 per cent in all developing regions, it was 22.9 per cent
in sub-Saharan Africa, 22.7 per cent in landlocked developing countries and 26.5
per cent in the least developed countries. And while 68 per cent of the world’s
people and 62 per cent of those in developing regions had access to an improved
sanitation facility in 2015, the share was just 30 per cent for sub-Saharan Africa and
36 per cent for Oceania.
134. The disaggregated information needed to address all vulnerable groups, as
specified in the 2030 Agenda, remains scarce. For example, few of the current
indicators can be disaggregated for migrants, refugees, persons with disabilities,
minorities and indigenous people. A global effort to improve data availability for all
population groups, including through improvements in the integration of data
sources, has already begun. Further work is needed to enhance the cover age, quality
and frequency of data to ensure that the most vulnerable and marginalized people
are the first to be reached.
IV. Note on the data and indicators
135. The information presented in the present report is based on a selection of
indicators for monitoring progress on the Sustainable Development Goals for which
data were available as of May 2016. Details concerning the availability and
compilation of data used to measure the indicators are outlined below. Some of the
challenges faced by national statistical offices and the international statistical
community in the production of such indicators are also set out in the paragraphs
that follow, as well as global initiatives under way to address them.
Global indicator framework for the follow-up and review of the Sustainable
Development Goals
136. In March 2016, at its forty-seventh session, the Statistical Commission agreed,
as a practical starting point, on a global indicator framework proposed by the
Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators, which
would be subject to future modifications (see E/2016/24, chap. I, sect. B, decision
47/101). That set of over 230 indicators is intended for the review of progress at the
global level (see E/CN.3/2016/2/Rev.1, annex IV). Indicators for monitoring at the 
E/2016/75
26/28 16-09102
regional, national and subnational levels will also be developed at the regional and
national levels. The decision of the Statistical Commission recognized that the
development of a robust and high-quality indicator framework was a technical
process that would require time and that refinements and improvements would be
made as knowledge improves and as new tools and data sources become available.
137. Additional indicators to monitor progress in implementing the commitments in
the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing
for Development and the means of implementation of the Susta inable Development
Goals will be presented in the annual report of the Inter-agency Task Force on
Financing for Development.
Data sources, regional groupings and baseline data
138. The national data provided to the international statistical system are often
adjusted for international comparability and, where lacking, are estimated. As
decided by the Statistical Commission and in accordance with Economic and Social
Council resolution 2006/6, estimates used for the compilation of global indicators
are produced in full consultation with national statistical authorities. A database of
available global, regional and country data and metadata for the indicators for the
Sustainable Development Goals, to accompany the present report, is maintained by
the Statistics Division and is available at: http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/.
139. The composition of regions and subregions in the present report is based on
United Nations geographical divisions, with some modifications necessary to create,
to the extent possible, groups of countries for which a meaningful analysis could be
carried out.7 Although the aggregate figures presented are a convenient way to track
progress, the situation of individual countries within a given region may vary
significantly from regional averages. As acknowledged by Member States in the
2030 Agenda, work is needed to establish baseline data where these are not yet
available.
The tier system and future refinements
140. The indicators agreed upon by the Statistical Commission were provisionally
categorized into three tiers by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable
Development Goal Indicators, as follows:
(a) Tier I: indicators with an established methodology and data already
widely available;
(b) Tier II: indicators with an established methodology but insufficient data
coverage;
(c) Tier III: indicators for which a methodology is being developed.
141. About 60 per cent of the indicators were provisionally classified as tier I and
II, and about 40 per cent as tier III. The present report, the first progress report on
the Sustainable Development Goals, is based mostly on indicators classified as tier I
or II.

E/2016/75
16-09102 27/28
142. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group will agree on a final classification of the
indicators in their Details of the regional groupings used for the present report will
be made available at: unstats.un.org/sdgs. respective tiers and will develop a
workplan, in consultation with specialized agencies and experts, to establish a
methodology for the indicators in tier III. The Group will also discuss available data
sources and methodology for improved coverage of tier II indicators and will
regularly review methodologies for tier III indicators. Further modifications will be
undertaken as a result of improved data availability, new methodologies or
interlinkages across targets, and will be reviewed and approved by the Statistical
Commission. The Group is also reviewing data flows from the national to the
international statistical system in order to streamline and optimize reporting
mechanisms. A plan for refining and reviewing the indicator framework will be
presented to the Statistical Commission at its forty-eighth session, in March 2017.
Improving data quality and availability
143. Data of good quality are vital for governments, international organizations,
civil society, the private sector and the general public in order to make informed
decisions and to ensure accountability for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
That said, tracking progress on the Sustainable Development Goals requires the
collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of an unprecedented amount of
data and statistics at the subnational, national, regional and global levels, including
those derived from official statistical systems and from new and innovative data
sources.
144. Several national statistical systems across the globe face serious challenges in
this regard. As a result, accurate and timely information about certain aspects of
people’s lives are unknown, numerous groups and individuals remain invisible, and
many development challenges are still poorly understood. In General Assembly
resolution 70/1, Member States recognized the crucial role of strengthened data
collection and capacity-building and committed to addressing the data gap (see
para. 57).
145. Towards that end, in March 2015, the Statistical Commission agreed to
establish a High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-building
for Statistics for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The High-level
Group is tasked with promoting national ownership of the monitoring of progress
towards the 2030 Agenda and fostering statistical capacity-building, partnerships
and coordination. The Group is currently working on a global action plan for
sustainable development data. The road map for the modernization and
strengthening of statistical systems addresses all aspects of the production and use
of data for sustainable development. It also identifies new and strategic ways to
efficiently mobilize resources to accomplish the objective of modernizing and
strengthening statistical systems.
146. Where possible, global monitoring should be based on comparable and
standardized national data obtained through well-established reporting mechanisms
from countries to the international statistical system. 8
Such mechanisms can be
improved by strengthening the coordination function of national statistical offices
and/or other national institutions. In order to fill data gaps and improve international

comparability, countries will need to adopt internationally agreed standards at the
national level, strengthen national statistical capacity and improve reporting
mechanisms. International organizations and regional mechanisms play a significant
role in facilitating the process.
147. The success of all such global initiatives will require capacity-building efforts.
In addition, new data sources and technologies for data collection will need to be
explored, including through partnerships with civil society, the private sector and
academia. The integration of geospatial information and statistical data will also be
essential for the production of a number of indicators. 

Goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. It also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access to basic services and support people harmed by climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.
The international poverty line is currently defined at $1.90 or below per person per day using 2011 United States dollars purchasing power parity (ppp). In the decade beginning in 2002, the proportion of the world’s population living below the poverty line dropped by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If growth rates during those 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth benefits all income groups of the population equally. However, if the growth rates over the longer period of 20 years prevail, the global poverty rate will likely be around 6 per cent. In other words, eliminating extreme poverty will require a significant change from historical growth rates.
In 2015, 10.2 per cent of the world’s workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. Young people are especially likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed youth aged 15 to 24 were considered working poor, compared to 9 per cent of adults.
Expanding social protection programmes and targeting appropriate schemes to the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty. Social protection programmes include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding and targeted food assistance, as well as social insurance and labour market programmes, including old-age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills training and wage subsidies, among others.
Social protections have expanded globally since 2000, as many developing countries adopted policies that afford protection for multiple contingencies. Pension coverage in particular is expanding rapidly. Over half (51 per cent) of people above retirement age received a pension according to data available for the period from 2010 to 2012. Almost all countries have child or maternity benefit programmes, and cash transfer schemes are increasing.
Despite progress over the past decade, increasing social protection for those most in need remains a priority. Globally, 18,000 children still die each day from poverty-related causes, and only 28 per cent of employed women are effectively protected through contributory and non-contributory maternity cash benefits. Most poor people remain outside social protection systems, especially in low-income countries. Of the entire population, only 1 out of 5 receive any type of social protection in low-income countries, compared with 2 out of 3 in upper-middle-income countries. The coverage gap is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, where most of the world’s poorest people live. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 15 per cent of those in the bottom income quintile have access to a social protection benefit.
Disaster risk reduction is essential to ending poverty and fostering sustainable development. Disaster risk is disproportionally higher in poorer countries with weaker institutions. In low- and lower-middle-income countries experiencing rapid economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is increasing at a faster pace than that at which risk-reducing capacities are being strengthened, leading to increased disaster risk.
Economic losses from internationally reported disasters, principally large-scale disasters, have grown steadily since 1990, reaching an estimated annual average of $200 billion in 2013. Reported damage to housing, schools and health-care facilities, along with agricultural production, shows statistically significant upward trends from 1990 onwards.

Goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. It also commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the year. This will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural productivity.
The fight against hunger has progressed over the past 15 years. Globally, the prevalence of hunger has declined, from 15 per cent according to figures for 2000 to 2002, to 11 per cent according to figures for 2014 to 2016. However, more than 790 million people worldwide still lack regular access to adequate amounts of dietary energy. If current trends continue, the zero hunger target will be largely missed by 2030. Many countries that failed to reach the target set as part of the Millennium Development Goals, of halving the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, have faced natural and human-induced disasters or political instability, resulting in protracted crises, with increased vulnerability and food insecurity affecting large parts of the population. The persistence of hunger is no longer simply a matter of food availability. More and better data on access to food can enable the tracking of progress and guide interventions to fight food insecurity and malnutrition.
Globally, in 2014, nearly 1 in 4 children under the age of 5, an estimated total of 159 million children, had stunted growth. Stunting is defined as inadequate height for age, an indicator of the cumulative effects of undernutrition and infection. Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa accounted for three quarters of the children under 5 with stunted growth in 2014. Another aspect of child malnutrition is the growing share of children who are overweight, a problem affecting nearly every region. Globally, between 2000 and 2014, the percentage of children under the age of 5 who were overweight grew from 5.1 per cent to 6.1 per cent.
Ending hunger and malnutrition relies heavily on sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. Genetic diversity in livestock breeds is crucial for agriculture and food production since it allows for the raising of farm animals in a wide range of environments and provides the basis for diverse products and services. Globally, 20 per cent of local livestock breeds, meaning breeds reported in only one country, are at risk of extinction. Another 16 per cent of breeds are stable, and the status of the remaining local breeds is unknown owing to a lack of data. The figures exclude livestock breeds that have already become extinct.
To increase the productive capacity of agriculture, more investment is needed, both public and private, from domestic and foreign sources. However, recent trends in government spending are not favourable. The agriculture orientation index, defined as agriculture’s share of government expenditures divided by the sector’s share of gross domestic product (GDP), fell globally from 0.37 to 0.25 between 2001 and 2013. The decline in the index was interrupted only temporarily during the food price crisis of 2006 to 2008, when governments increased agricultural spending.
Since the late 1990s, the percentage of aid for supporting agriculture in developing countries has been stable at around 8 per cent, when measured as a share of sector-allocable aid from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This has decreased, from a peak of 20 per cent in the mid-1980s, as a result of donors beginning to focus more on improving governance, building social capital and bolstering fragile States.
One of the targets for Goal 2 calls for correcting and preventing distortions in world agricultural markets, including the elimination of all forms of agricultural export subsidies. Those subsidies mask market signals, reduce competitiveness and can lead to environmental damage and the inequitable distribution of benefits. That said, some progress is being made, with members of the World Trade Organization adopting a ministerial decision, in December 2015, on eliminating export subsidies for agricultural products and restraining export measures that have an equivalent effect.

Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all, at every stage of life. The Goal addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. It also calls for more research and development, increased health financing, and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management.
Between 2000 and 2015, the global maternal mortality ratio, or number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, declined by 37 per cent, to an estimated ratio of 216 per 100,000 live births in 2015. Almost all maternal deaths occur in low-resource settings and can be prevented. Globally, 3 out of 4 births were assisted by skilled health-care personnel in 2015. Under-five mortality rates fell rapidly from 2000 to 2015, declining by 44 per cent globally. Nevertheless, an estimated 5.9 million children under the age of 5 died in 2015, with a global under-five mortality rate of 43 per 1,000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate, that is, the likelihood of dying in the first 28 days of life, declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. Over that period, progress in the rate of child survival among children aged 1 to 59 months outpaced advances in reducing neonatal mortality; as a result, neonatal deaths now represent a larger share (45 per cent) of all under-five deaths.
Preventing unintended pregnancy and reducing adolescent childbearing through universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services are critical to further advances in the health of women, children and adolescents. Worldwide, in 2015, approximately 3 in 4 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) who were married or in union satisfied their need for family planning by using modern contraceptive methods; in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, however, the share was less than half. Childbearing in adolescence has steadily declined in almost all regions, but wide disparities persist: in 2015, the birth rate among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 ranged from 7 births per 1,000 girls in Eastern Asia to 102 births per 1,000 girls in sub-Saharan Africa.
The incidence of major infectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, has declined globally since 2000. Globally in 2015, the number of new HIV infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 uninfected people; 2.1 million people became newly infected that year. The incidence of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.5 new cases per 1,000 uninfected people. In 2014, 9.6 million new cases of tuberculosis (133 cases per 100,000 people) were reported worldwide, with 58 per cent of them in South-Eastern Asia and the Western Pacific. Almost half the world’s population is at risk of malaria and, in 2015, the incidence rate was 91 new cases per 1,000 people at risk, an estimated total of 214 million cases. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 89 per cent of all malaria cases worldwide, with an incidence rate of 235 cases per 1,000 people at risk. In 2014, at least 1.7 billion people, in 185 countries, required treatment for at least one neglected tropical disease.
According to estimates from 2012, around 38 million deaths per year, accounting for 68 per cent of all deaths worldwide, were attributable to non communicable diseases. Of all deaths among persons under the age of 70, commonly referred to as premature deaths, an estimated 52 per cent were as a result of non-communicable diseases. Over three quarters of premature deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. Globally, premature mortality from those four main categories of non communicable disease declined by 15 per cent between 2000 and 2012. Reducing tobacco use will be critical for meeting the proposed target of reducing premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third. In 2015, over 1.1 billion people consumed tobacco, with far more male (945 million) than female (180 million) smokers.
Unhealthy environmental conditions increase the risk of both non communicable and infectious diseases, which is reflected in the strong integrated nature of the Goals. In 2012, an estimated 889,000 people died from infectious diseases caused largely by faecal contamination of water and soil and by inadequate hand-washing facilities and practices resulting from poor or non-existent sanitation services. In 2012, household and ambient air pollution resulted in some 6.5 million deaths.
Substance use and substance-use disorders have also created a significant public health burden. Worldwide, average alcohol consumption in 2015 was estimated at 6.3l of pure alcohol per person among those aged 15 or older, with wide variations across countries. Alcohol consumption was highest in the developed regions (10.4l per person) and lowest in Northern Africa (0.5l per person). In 2013, only about 1 in 6 people worldwide suffering from drug-use disorders received treatment. Approximately 1 in 18 people with drug-use disorders received treatment in Africa that year, compared with 1 in 5 in Western and Central Europe.
Mental disorders occur in all regions and cultures. The most common are anxiety and depression, which, not infrequently, can lead to suicide. In 2012, an estimated 800,000 people worldwide committed suicide, and 86 per cent of them were under the age of 70. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death among those between the ages of 15 and 29.
Around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013. Halving the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is an ambitious goal given the dramatic increase in the number of vehicles, which nearly doubled between 2000 and 2013.
Total official flows from all providers for medical research and basic health sectors were $8.9 billion in 2014. Within this total, official development assistance (ODA) from DAC donors was $4.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 20 per cent in real terms since 2010, with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America accounting for $2.6 billion of that total. In 2014, $1 billion was spent on malaria control and $1.2 billion was spent on other infectious diseases, excluding AIDS.

Despite progress, the world failed to meet the Millennium Development Goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015. In 2013, the latest year for which data are available, 59 million children of primary-school age were out of school. Estimates show that, among those 59 million children, 1 in 5 of those children had dropped out and recent trends suggest that 2 in 5 of out-of-school children will never set foot in a classroom. The Sustainable Development Goals clearly recognize that this gap must be closed, even as the international community more explicitly addresses the challenges of quality and equity.
Measuring learning achievement, starting in the early grades, will help to identify where schools are failing to meet their commitments to children and to formulate appropriate remedial action. For example, data for 2013 from 15 Latin American countries show that in six countries, fewer than 50 per cent of third graders had a minimum level of proficiency in mathematics; in three countries, fewer than half were proficient in reading.
At the end of primary school, children should be able to read and write and to understand and use basic concepts in mathematics. However, in 2014, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve even minimum levels of proficiency in reading, in 10 African countries, and in nine of those countries, between 40 per cent and 90 per cent of children failed to achieve minimum levels of proficiency in mathematics.
The end of lower secondary education often coincides with the end of compulsory education. By this stage, young people should be able to master subject-related knowledge and skills and possess personal and social skills. Data from 38 countries in the developed regions show that, in the majority of those countries, at least 75 per cent of young people achieved at least a minimum proficiency in reading and/or mathematics; the same was true for only 5 out of 22 countries, in developing regions, for which data were available.
Completion rates for both primary and lower secondary education has been rising steadily since 2000. Completion rates for primary education in both developed and developing regions exceeded 90 per cent in 2013. At the lower secondary level, the gap between developed and developing regions has narrowed substantially, but still stood at nearly 20 percentage points in 2013 (91 per cent for developed regions and 72 per cent for developing regions).
Quality early education provides children with basic cognitive and language skills and fosters emotional development. In the majority of the 58 countries with available data for the period 2009-2015, more than half of children between the ages of 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy, numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and learning.
Goal 4 strongly supports the reduction of persistent disparities. Worldwide, in 2013, two thirds of the 757 million adults (aged 15 and over) who were unable to read and write were women. Globally, in 2013, 1 in 10 girls were out of school, compared to 1 in 12 boys. Children from the poorest 20 per cent of households are nearly four times more likely to be out of school than their richest peers. Out-of-school rates are also higher in rural areas and among children from households headed by someone with less than a primary education.
To fulfil the promise of universal primary and secondary education, new primary school teachers are needed, with current estimates showing a need for nearly 26 million of them by 2030. Africa faces the greatest challenges in this regard, with nearly 7 in 10 countries experiencing acute shortages of trained primary school teachers. In 2013, only 71 per cent of teachers in sub-Saharan Africa and 84 per cent in Northern Africa were trained in accordance with national standards.
Official development assistance for educational scholarships amounted to around $1.1 billion annually from 2011 to 2013. It totalled $1.2 billion in 2014, with Australia, France and Japan being the largest contributors.

Gender equality and women’s empowerment have advanced in recent decades. Girls’ access to education has improved, the rate of child marriage declined and progress was made in the area of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including fewer maternal deaths. Nevertheless, gender equality remains a persistent challenge for countries worldwide and the lack of such equality is a major obstacle to sustainable development.
Assuring women’s rights through legal frameworks is a first step in addressing discrimination against them. As of 2014, 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions; another 52 countries have yet to make this important commitment. In 132 countries, the statutory legal age of marriage is equal for women and men, while in another 63 countries, the legal age of marriage is lower for women than for men.
Violence against women and girls violates their human rights and hinders development. Most such violence is perpetrated by intimate partners, with available data from surveys conducted between 2005 and 2015, in 52 countries, (including only one country from the developed regions) indicating that 21 per cent of girls and women aged between 15 and 49 experienced physical and/or sexual violence at the hands of an intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Estimates on the risks of violence experienced by women with disabilities, women from ethnic minorities and among women above the age of 50 are not yet included, owing to data limitations. Additionally, human trafficking disproportionately affects women and girls, since 70 per cent of all victims detected worldwide are female.
Globally, the proportion of women aged between 20 and 24 who reported that they were married before their eighteenth birthday dropped from 32 per cent around 1990 to 26 per cent around 2015. Child marriage is most common in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with 44 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in Southern Asia and 37 per cent of women married before their eighteenth birthday in sub-Saharan Africa. The marriage of girls under the age 15 is also highest in those two regions, at 16 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Social norms can and do change, however, with the rate of marriage of girls under the age of 15 declining globally from 12 per cent around 1990 to 7 per cent around 2015, although disparities are found across regions and countries. The most rapid reduction in child marriage overall was recorded in Northern Africa, where the percentage of women married before the age of 18 dropped by more than half, from 29 per cent to 13 per cent, over the past 25 years.
The harmful practice of female genital mutilation/cutting is another human rights violation that affects girls and women worldwide. While the exact number of girls and women globally who have undergone the procedure is unknown, at least 200 million have been subjected to the procedure in 30 countries with representative prevalence data. Overall, rates of female genital mutilation/cutting have been declining over the past three decades. However, not all countries have made progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. Today, in the 30 countries, for which data were available, around 1 in 3 girls aged 15 to 19 have undergone the practice, versus 1 in 2 in the mid-1980s.
In every region, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid work, including caregiving and such household tasks as cooking and cleaning. On average, women report that they spend 19 per cent of their time each day in unpaid activities, versus 8 per cent for men. The responsibilities of unpaid care and domestic work, combined with paid work, means greater total work burdens for women and girls and less time for rest, self-care, learning and other activities.
Globally, women’s participation in parliament rose to 23 per cent in 2016, representing an increase by 6 percentage points over a decade. Slow progress in this area is in contrast with more women in parliamentary leadership positions. In 2016, the number of women speakers of national parliaments jumped from 43 to 49 (out of the 273 posts globally); women accounted for 18 per cent of all speakers of parliament in January 2016.

Water and sanitation are at the very core of sustainable development, critical to the survival of people and the planet. Goal 6 not only addresses the issues relating to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, but also the quality and sustainability of water resources worldwide.
In 2015, 4.9 billion people globally used an improved sanitation facility; 2.4 billion did not. Among those lacking adequate sanitation were 946 million people without any facilities at all, who continued to practise open defecation. In 2015, 68 per cent of the global population was using improved sanitation facilities compared to 59 per cent in 2000. Nevertheless, the unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater continues to present a major risk to public health and the environment.
More progress has been made in access to drinking water. In 2015, 6.6 billion people, or 91 per cent of the global population, used an improved drinking water source, versus 82 per cent in 2000. Despite that improvement, an estimated 663 million people were using unimproved water sources or surface water that year. While coverage was around 90 per cent or more in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, widespread inequalities persist within and among countries. Moreover, not all improved sources are safe. For instance, in 2012 it was estimated that at least 1.8 billion people were exposed to drinking water sources contaminated with faecal matter.
Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of “water stress”, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. Currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. Already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. Of those, 10 countries, on the Arabian Peninsula, in Central Asia and in Northern Africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources.
Integrated water resources management, one of the follow-up actions to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation), aims to address this urgent situation. In 2012, 65 per cent of the 130 countries that responded to a survey question on integrated water resources management reported that management plans were in place at the national level.
Total official flows for water and sanitation were $10 billion in 2014, of which total aid flows from DAC donors amounted to $8 billion. Aid for water and sanitation nearly doubled as a share of ODA during the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990). Since that time, on average, it has remained at around 7 per cent of total aid flows. Better targeting and tracking of water aid within the context of national situations is needed. For instance, numerous countries with limited access to water supply and/or sanitation have been receiving minimal external assistance (typically less than $2 per capita annually), while other countries with higher levels of access have received much more (at least $30 per capita a year).
Effective water and sanitation management also depends on the participation of stakeholders. According to a 2013-2014 Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water survey, 83 per cent of the 94 countries surveyed reported that procedures for stakeholder participation were clearly defined in law or policy. In the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus is being refined to also include the participation of local communities, which will be captured in the next cycle of Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water monitoring.

Energy is crucial for achieving almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals, from its role in the eradication of poverty through advancements in health, education, water supply and industrialization, to combating climate change.
The proportion of the global population with access to electricity has increased steadily, from 79 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2012. Still, 1.1 billion people are without this valuable service. Recent global progress in this area has been driven largely by Asia, where access is expanding at more than twice the pace of demographic growth. Of those gaining access to electricity worldwide since 2010, 80 per cent are urban dwellers.
The proportion of the world’s population with access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking increased from 51 per cent in 2000 to 58 per cent in 2014, although there has been limited progress since 2010. The absolute number of people relying on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking, such as solid fuels and kerosene, however, has actually increased, reaching an estimated three billion people. Limited progress since 2010 falls substantially short of global population growth and is almost exclusively confined to urban areas.
The share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the world’s total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. More telling is the fact that modern renewable energy consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for 60 per cent of all new power-generating capacity in 2014. In absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from Eastern Asia. The technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012.
Energy intensity, calculated by dividing total primary energy supply by GDP, reveals how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. Globally, energy intensity decreased by 1.7 per cent per year from 2010 to 2012. This represents a considerable improvement over the period from 1990 to 2010, when it decreased by 1.2 per cent a year. As a result, global energy intensity, which stood at 6.7 (millijoules (mJ) per 2011 United States dollar ppp) in 2000 fell to 5.7 by 2012. The proportion of the world’s energy use covered by mandatory energy efficiency regulation, which has almost doubled over the past decade, from 14 per cent in 2005 to 27 per cent in 2014, was a factor. Still, current progress is only about two thirds of the pace needed to double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Among end-use sectors, industry was the largest contributor to reduced energy intensity, followed closely by transportation. About 68 per cent of the savings in energy intensity between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, with Eastern Asia as the largest contributor.

Sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. The global annual growth rate of real GDP per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). Developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively.
Labour productivity (measured by GDP per worker) spurs economic growth. Growth in labour productivity in developing regions far outpaced that of developed regions, especially in Asia. Between 2010 and 2015, labour productivity grew by 0.9 per cent per year, on average, in developed regions, while rising by 6.7 per cent per year, on average, in Eastern Asia, the region with the fastest growth. Despite rapid growth in some developing regions, labour productivity remains far higher in the developed regions. In 2015, the average worker in developed regions produced 23 times the annual output of an average worker in sub-Saharan Africa (which has the lowest labour productivity in developing regions), and 2.5 times that of an average worker in Western Asia (which has the highest labour productivity in developing regions).
The global unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in 2015, down from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2009, mostly owing to a decline in unemployment in the developed regions. Unemployment affects population groups differently. Globally, women and youth (aged 15 to 24) are more likely to face unemployment than men and adults aged 25 and over. In all regions, except Eastern Asia and the developed regions, the unemployment rate among women is higher than that of men. In almost all regions, the rate of youth unemployment is more than twice that of adults.
Although the number of children engaged in child labour declined globally by one third from 2000 to 2012 (from 246 million to 168 million), more than half of child labourers in 2012 (85 million) were engaged in hazardous forms of work. The incidence of child labour was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where 21 per cent of children were employed as child labourers. Of all child labourers worldwide, 59 per cent were engaged in agricultural activities in 2012.
While economic growth and employment are important for economic security, access to financial services is an essential component of inclusive growth. Between 2011 and 2014, the proportion of the world’s adult population with an account at a financial institution or a mobile money service provider increased from 51 per cent to 62 per cent, meaning that 700 million adults became account holders during this period. Financial exclusion disproportionately affected women and the poor. The proportion of women who are account holders is 9 percentage points lower than the proportion of men who are account holders. Moreover, the proportion of account holders among the poorest 40 per cent of households is 14 percentage points lower than among those living in the richest 60 per cent of households.
In 2014, aid for trade assistance was $54.8 billion, an increase of almost 120 per cent over the period from 2002 to 2005. However, total commitments fell slightly (by $1 billion) in 2014 compared to 2013, driven mainly by a $4.7 billion drop in support for transport and storage. A total of 146 developing countries received aid for trade assistance in 2014, with lower-middle-income countries receiving 39.4 per cent of the total, the least developed countries receiving 26.3 per cent and upper-middle-income countries receiving 19 per cent. On a per capita basis, however, the least developed countries received $10 per capita, more than any other income group and more than twice the global average.

Goal 9 encompasses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical systems and structures essential to the operation of a society or enterprise. Industrialization drives economic growth, creates job opportunities and thereby reduces income poverty. Innovation advances the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and prompts the development of new skills.
An important component of physical infrastructure is air shipping and air travel. In 2014, 45 per cent of all air passengers originated from developing regions; 55 per cent originated from developed regions. However, in the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, air passenger volume was extremely low, making up only 0.8 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, of the global total. Similar patterns are found for freight volumes in air transit: the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States made up only 1.1 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 2.6 per cent of the global total, respectively, in 2014.
Manufacturing is a foundation of economic development, employment and social stability. In 2015, the share of manufacturing value added in terms of GDP of developed regions was estimated at 13 per cent, a decrease over the past decade owing largely to the increasing role of services in developed regions. In contrast, the share of manufacturing value added in GDP remained relatively stagnant for developing regions, increasing marginally from 19 per cent in 2005 to 21 per cent in 2015. Those values hide substantial differences, with manufacturing value added contributing over 31 per cent to GDP in Eastern Asia and 10 per cent or less in both sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania. The least developed countries face particular challenges in industrializing. Although those countries represent 13 per cent of the global population, they contribute less than 1 per cent of global manufacturing value added. Worldwide, about 500 million people are employed in manufacturing. While manufacturing job numbers have fallen in industrialized countries, they have steadily increased in developing countries. In the least developed countries, agricultural and traditional sectors remain the main sources of employment.
In developing countries, small-scale industries accounted for an estimated 15 per cent to 20 per cent of value added and 25 per cent to 30 per cent of total industrial employment in 2015. However, access to financial services in those countries remains a problem. Globally, the credit gap for small and medium enterprises (defined as having between 5 and 99 employees) was estimated at $3.2 trillion to $3.9 trillion in 2012. In emerging markets, between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of all small and medium enterprises are unserved or underserved by financial services.
As the structure of world economies shifts to less energy-intensive industries and countries implement policies for enhanced energy efficiency, almost all regions have shown a reduction in carbon intensity of GDP. Global carbon dioxide emissions per unit of value added showed a steady decline between 1990 and 2013, a decrease of about 30 per cent.
Innovation and the creation of new and more sustainable industries are spurred by investments in research and development. Global expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP stood at 1.7 per cent in 2013. However, this figure masks wide disparities. expenditure on research and development was 2.4 per cent of GDP for developed regions, 1.2 per cent for developing regions, and below 0.3 per cent for the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. The number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants showed a similar pattern. While the global average was 1,083 researchers per 1 million inhabitants, the ratio ranged from 65 per 1 million in the least developed countries to 3,641 per 1 million in developed regions.
Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing regions reached $59.5 billion in 2014. The main sectors receiving assistance were transport and energy.
Infrastructure and economic development also rely on information and communications technology. Mobile cellular services have spread rapidly around the world, allowing people in previously unconnected areas to join the global information society. By 2015, the percentage of the population living in areas covered by mobile broadband networks stood at 69 per cent globally. In rural areas, the share was only 29 per cent.

Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country. The Goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance.
Target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. This was true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. However, this does not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced negative growth rates over that period.
The labour share of GDP, which represents the proportion of wages and social protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary income inequality. A shift of income away from labour towards capital has contributed to rising inequality. Globally, the labour share of GDP decreased from 57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a decline in employers’ social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was stable or slightly upward in developing regions.
Preferential treatment for developing countries and the least developed countries in trade can help reduce inequalities by creating more export opportunities. Major developed country markets already offer duty-free market access to the least developed countries on most of their tariff lines. But even when they do not, as in the case of some agricultural products, the average applied tariff rate is often close to zero per cent. The share of exports from the least developed countries and developing regions that benefitted from duty-free treatment increased from 2000 to 2014, reaching 79 per cent for developing countries and 84 per cent for the least developed countries. The comparative advantage of the least developed countries in duty-free access varies depending on the product groups analysed. Almost all agricultural products from the least developed countries (98 per cent) were exempt from duties by developed countries, versus 74 per cent of products from developing countries. Shares of exports exempt from duties diverged even more for textiles and clothing: the rate for both product groups for the least developed countries was around 70 per cent, while for developing countries it was 41 per cent for textiles and 34 per cent for clothing.
Official development assistance and financial flows contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries. In 2014, total resource flows for development to the least developed countries totalled $55.2 billion, and eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (GNI) for ODA to the least developed countries. Preliminary ODA figures for 2015 show that bilateral net ODA to the least developed countries increased by 4 per cent in real terms, compared to 2014.
People migrate for many reasons, including better employment opportunities and higher wages. When successful, many migrants send money back to their country of origin to care of family members. Remittances to developing countries have increased slightly, rising to $431.6 billion in 2015, up 0.4 per cent from 2014. In contrast, global remittances (including those to developed countries) were estimated at $582 billion in 2015, a decline of 1.7 per cent from 2014. Even with the global contraction in remittance flows in 2015, the longer term trend is upward. However, the cost of sending money across national borders is significant, averaging 7.5 per cent of the amount remitted in 2015, down from 10 per cent in 2008 but still above the 3 per cent called for in target 10.c.

More than half the world’s population lives in cities. By 2030, it is projected that 6 out of 10 people will be urban dwellers. Despite numerous planning challenges, well-managed cities and other human settlements can be incubators for innovation and ingenuity and key drivers of sustainable development.
However, as more people migrate to cities in search of a better life and urban populations grow, housing issues intensify. Already in 2014, 30 per cent of the urban population lived in slum-like conditions; in sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion was 55 per cent, the highest of any region. Globally, more than 880 million people were living in slums in 2014. This estimate does not include people in inadequate or unaffordable housing (defined as costing more than 30 per cent of total monthly household income).
As population growth outpaces available land, cities expand far beyond their formal administrative boundaries. This urban sprawl can be seen in many cities around the world, and not only in developing regions. From 2000 to 2015, the ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate in Eastern Asia and the Oceania was the highest in the world, with developed regions second. Other regions, such as South-Eastern Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, showed a decrease in that indicator over the same time period. Unfortunately, a low value for this ratio is not necessarily an indication that urban dwellers are faring well, as this can indicate a prevalence of overcrowded slums. Unplanned urban sprawl undermines other determinants of sustainable development. For example, for every 10 per cent increase in sprawl, there is a 5.7 per cent increase in per capita carbon dioxide emissions and a 9.6 per cent increase in per capita hazardous pollution. This illustrates the important interlinkages across the goals and targets.
Likewise, managing solid waste is often problematic in densely populated areas. In fact, in many developing regions, less than half of solid waste is safely disposed of. As per capita waste generation continues to rise, the collection and safe disposal of solid waste will continue to require serious attention.
Urban air pollution also challenged cities around the world, causing illness and millions of premature deaths annually. In 2014, around half the global urban population was exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than maximum standards set by the World Health Organization.
The quest for sustainable and coordinated urban development starts with national policies and regional development plans. As of 2015, 142 countries had a national urban policy in place or under development. Those countries are home to 75 per cent of the world’s urban population.

Economic growth and development require the production of goods and services that improve the quality of life. Sustainable growth and development require minimizing the natural resources and toxic materials used, and the waste and pollutants generated, throughout the entire production and consumption process.
Two measures, material footprint and domestic material consumption, provide an accounting of global material extraction and use, as well as flows or consumption of materials in countries. The material footprint reflects the amount of primary materials required to meet a country’s needs. It is an indicator of the material standard of living or level of capitalization of an economy. Domestic material consumption measures the amount of natural resources used in economic processes.
In 2010, the total material footprint in developed regions was significantly higher than that of developing regions, 23.6 kg per unit of GDP versus 14.5 kg per unit of GDP, respectively. The material footprint of developing regions increased from 2000 to 2010, with non-metallic minerals showing the largest increase.
Domestic material consumption in developed regions has diminished slightly, from 17.5 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 15.3 tonnes per capita in 2010. It remains significantly higher than the value for developing regions, which stood at 8.9 tonnes per capita in 2010. Domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all developing regions from 2000 to 2010, except in Africa, where it remained relatively stable (around 4 tonnes per capita), and Oceania, where it decreased from around 10.7 to 7.7 tonnes per capita. The rise in domestic material consumption per capita in Asia during that period is primarily a result of rapid industrialization.
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants established international frameworks to achieve the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, chemicals and persistent organic pollutants. With six exceptions, all Member States are party to at least one of those conventions. The number of parties to those conventions rose significantly from 2005 to 2015, particularly in Africa and Oceania. There are now 183 parties to the Basel Convention, 180 to the Stockholm Convention and 155 to the Rotterdam Convention.

Climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented impacts disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. Urgent action to combat climate change and minimize its disruptions is integral to the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
The global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing sustainable low-carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 April 2016, 175 Member States signed the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future.
Climate change often exacerbates disasters. Between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. As a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. In 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk.
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are responsible for providing a range of national reports on their efforts to implement the agreement. As of 4 April 2016, 161 intended nationally determined contributions, from 189 of the 197 Parties to the Framework Convention (the European Commission submitted one joint intended determined contribution) had been recorded by the secretariat of the Framework Convention, providing insights into the efforts many countries are taking to integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning. Among those countries, 137 parties included an adaptation component in their intended nationally determined contributions. Some countries stressed that adaptation was their main climate change priority, with strong linkages to other aspects of national development, sustainability and security. In order to help countries move forward on climate action, a global stocktaking was established, in the context of the Paris Agreement, to assess collective progress every five years. The process will begin in 2018, with a facilitative dialogue to review the efforts of parties towards emissions reductions and to inform the preparation of final nationally determined contributions.
As parties scale up climate change action, enhanced cooperation, capacity-building and access to financial and technical support will be needed to help many countries realize their priorities, including those identified in intended nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. Developed countries have committed to mobilizing, by 2020, $100 billion a year in climate financing from a wide variety of sources to help address the needs of developing countries. By 2025, parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will set a new collective goal of at least $100 billion per year. The Green Climate Fund, a mechanism within the Framework Convention created to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices, is an important delivery vehicle for this financing. As of May 2016, the Green Climate Fund had mobilized $10.3 billion.
Climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing States. The preparation of national adaptation programmes of action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is helping the least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Least Developed Countries Expert Group. In addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind.

Oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well-being and social and economic development worldwide. They are particularly crucial for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the global population in 2010. Oceans provide livelihoods and tourism benefits, as well as subsistence and income. They also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and protecting coastal areas from flooding and erosion. In fact, coastal and marine resources contribute an estimated $28 trillion to the global economy each year through ecosystem services. However, those resources are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution. The sustainable use and preservation of marine and coastal ecosystems and their biological diversity is essential to achieving the 2030 Agenda, in particular for small island developing States.
Pollution of both land and seas is a threat in many coastal regions. In addition, since river basins, marine ecosystems and the atmosphere are all part of hydrological systems, the effects of such pollution are often felt far from their source. In many coastal communities, pollution and eutrophication, which is the presence of excessive nutrients in water, frequently owing to runoff from the land, causing dense plant growth and the death of animal life, are driving detrimental changes. The five large marine ecosystems most at risk from coastal eutrophication, according to a global comparative assessment undertaken in 2016 as part of the Transboundary Water Assessment Programme, are the Bay of Bengal, the East China Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Brazil Shelf and the South China Sea.
Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ocean has absorbed about one third of the carbon dioxide released by human activities, thereby mitigating the full impact of climate change. However, this comes at a steep ecological price, as dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater lowers the pH level of oceans, thereby increasing acidity and changing the biogeochemical carbonate balance. Concerns about ocean acidification, first expressed in the early 1980s, have now been confirmed, and the extent of its impact on marine ecosystems is being investigated.
Fisheries contribute significantly to global food security, livelihoods and the economy. However, if not sustainably managed, fishing can damage fish habitats. Ultimately, overfishing impairs the functioning of ecosystems and reduces biodiversity, with negative repercussions for sustainable social and economic development. In order to achieve a healthy balance, fish stocks must be maintained within biologically sustainable limits, at or above the abundance level that can produce maximum sustainable yields. Based on an analysis of assessed stocks, the percentage of world marine fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013. Fortunately, the downward trend has slowed and appears to have stabilized since 2008.
Biodiverse marine sites require safeguarding to ensure sustainable long-term use of their precious natural resources. Globally, in 2014, 8.4 per cent of the marine environment under national jurisdiction (up to 200 nautical miles from shore) and 0.25 per cent of the marine environment beyond national jurisdiction were under protection. From 2000 to 2016, the share of marine sites around the world that are designated as key biodiversity areas and are completely covered by protected areas increased from 15 per cent to 19 per cent.

Preserving diverse forms of life on land requires targeted efforts to protect, restore and promote the conservation and sustainable use of terrestrial and other ecosystems. Goal 15 focuses specifically on managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded lands and successfully combating desertification, reducing degraded natural habitats and ending biodiversity loss.
Between 1990 and 2015, the world’s forest area diminished from 31.7 per cent of the world’s total land mass to 30.7 per cent. The loss was mainly attributable to the conversion of forest to other land uses, such as agriculture and infrastructure development. Meanwhile, other areas were transformed into forests through planting, landscape restoration or the natural expansion of forest. Owing to the balance of the two processes and efforts to slow deforestation, the global net loss of forest area declined from 7.3 million hectares per year in the 1990s to 3.3 million hectares per year during the period from 2010 to 2015.
To safeguard places that contribute significantly to global biodiversity, protected areas have been established and identified as key biodiversity areas. In 2014, 15.2 per cent of the world’s terrestrial and freshwater environments were covered by protected areas. The percentage of terrestrial key biodiversity areas covered by protected areas has increased, from 16.5 per cent in 2000 to 19.3 per cent in 2016. Over the same period, the share of freshwater key biodiversity areas that are protected has increased from 13.8 per cent to 16.6 per cent, and the share of mountain key biodiversity areas under protection has grown from 18.1 per cent to 20.1 per cent.
The focus in Goal 15 on halting biodiversity loss comes at a critical time, since many species of amphibians, birds and mammals are sliding towards extinction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List Index, amphibians are declining most rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean, primarily as a result of the chytrid fungal disease, one of numerous wildlife diseases on the rise worldwide. The greatest extinction risks for birds and mammals are found in South-Eastern Asia, mainly owing to the conversion of lowland forests. However, their decline is not inevitable, with extinction risks for vertebrate species having been reversed in five small island developing States (the Cook Islands, Fiji, Mauritius, Seychelles and Tonga) as a result of conservation actions over the past several decades.
Conservation efforts can also be thwarted by poaching and the trafficking of wildlife. Since 1999, at least 7,000 species of animals and plants have been detected in illegal trade, and the list of species under international protection continues to grow. Comparing the size of legal trade in wildlife products (about 900,000 transactions per year) to the quantity of wildlife seized (about 16,000 seizures per year) provides an indication of the scope of illicit wildlife trafficking. The value of legal and illicit wildlife products can also be compared. For example, the value of recorded seizures of Crocodylus genus represents between 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent of the value of legal protected exports of this species between 2009 and 2013, with no clear trend discernible.
In 2014, bilateral ODA to support biodiversity amounted to $7 billion, an increase of 16 per cent in real terms over 2013. The two largest recipients of biodiversity assistance were the Philippines and India, which together received about $1 billion of the total aid.

Peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. Several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms.
The number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. The worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. Yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. Moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs.
Various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In Northern Africa, the share was more than 90 per cent.
Globally, the share of girls and boys among victims of human trafficking (21 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively) peaked in 2011. By 2014, the figures had dropped to 18 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, but were still almost twice the levels recorded for 2004.
Sexual violence is one of the most unsettling of children’s rights violations. Yet underreporting and the lack of comparable data limit understanding of the full extent of the problem. Survey data from 31 low- and middle-income countries suggest that the proportion of women aged between 18 and 29 who experienced sexual violence for the first time before the age of 18 varies widely, ranging from zero to 16 per cent. Comparable data on the experiences of men are only available for five countries, but values are lower than those reported among women in the same countries.
Progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-2014. However, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. In Southern Asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005.
Among victims of robbery, between one quarter and one half reported the crime to the police, in 27 countries with available data. The data suggest a significant gap in citizens’ access to and trust in authorities. Although official data on the prevalence of bribery are limited, figures from 19 countries indicate that the rate of prevalence of bribery may reach as high as 50 per cent among citizens who had contact with public officials, undermining trust in state institutions.
Registering children at birth is a first step in securing recognition before the law and safeguarding individual rights and access to justice. Despite recent progress, the births of more than 1 in 4 children under the age of 5 worldwide have not been recorded. In sub-Saharan Africa, over half (54 per cent) of children have not been registered by their fifth birthday. Globally, children living in urban areas are around 1.5 times more likely to be registered than their rural counterparts. In most regions, birth registration rates tend to be highest among the richest 20 per cent of the population.
Efforts are under way to make national and international institutions more effective, inclusive and transparent. Over the past 10 years, nearly two thirds of 144 countries with available data were able to plan their national budgets effectively (where final expenses remained within 10 per cent of original budgets). Voting rights assigned to various groups of countries in international institutions is one indication of inclusivity at the international level. For example, while developing countries account for 63 per cent of voting rights in the African Development Bank, this figure is only 35 per cent in the International Monetary Fund and 38 per cent in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of the World Bank Group.
A free press is closely linked to access to information and the protection of human rights, but the trend in this regard is discouraging. The number of journalists killed increased from 65 in 2010 to 114 in 2015, despite the fact that, by 2013, 90 States had adopted laws on freedom of and/or access to information.
The proportion of countries with national human rights institutions has doubled over the past 15 years, reaching 35.5 per cent by the end of 2015. The share of such institutions that are compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles) (adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134) was highest in developed regions (46 per cent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (41 per cent).

Achieving the ambitious targets of the 2030 Agenda requires a revitalized and enhanced global partnership that brings together Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizes all available resources. Enhancing support to developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing States, is fundamental to equitable progress for all.
Finance
In 2015, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD totalled $131.6 billion. Taking account of inflation and the rise in the value of the dollar in 2015, this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in 2014, and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from those countries as a share of their gross national income was 0.30 per cent, on par with 2014. Most of the increase was owing to higher expenditures for costs associated with refugees. However, even if those costs are excluded, ODA still rose by 1.7 per cent. Seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
Information and communications technology
Fixed-broadband services remain largely unaffordable and unavailable across much of the population in developing regions, highlighting digital divides in access to high-speed, high-capacity Internet services. By 2015, fixed-broadband penetration had reached 29 per cent in developed regions, but only 7.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, in developing regions and the least developed countries. Major disparities are also found in Internet use. In developing regions, one third of the population is online versus 1 in 10 people in the least developed countries. Data also reveal that more men than women are online. In 2015, globally, the Internet user penetration rate was about 11 per cent lower for women than for men. The gender gap is even higher in developing regions (15 per cent) and highest in the least developed countries (29 per cent).
Capacity-building
Net ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $23 billion in 2014; of that total, sub-Saharan Africa received $6 billion and Southern and Central Asia received $4.6 billion. The main sectors receiving assistance were public administration, environment and energy, which together were allocated a total of $9.3 billion.
Trade
The weighted average of applied tariffs has been decreasing over time, but still varies widely across regions and country groups on main product sectors. Average agricultural tariffs on imports coming into Asia, for instance, are the highest in the world, at around 27 per cent for Southern Asia and 20 per cent for Eastern Asia in 2015, under most-favoured nation status.
In 14 years, the least developed countries’ share in world merchandise exports nearly doubled, from 0.6 per cent in 2000 to 1.1 per cent in 2014. The key driver of export growth during that period was a massive rise in the price of fuel, ores and metals, reflecting a high demand in developing countries, notably China. In services, the least developed countries increased their share of world exports to 0.8 per cent in 2014 ($40 billion), up from 0.5 per cent in 2005.
Data, monitoring and accountability
The requirements of the indicators developed in the context of the Millennium Development Goals have fostered stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions between 2010 and 2015, including in sub-Saharan Africa and the least developed countries. However, the overall number of plans declined from 56 to 54 among the countries being observed, since the time period of some existing plans expired.
Financial support for statistical capacity amounted to $325 million in 2013, compared with $379 million in 2010. However, assistance to the least developed countries, in this regard, tripled during the period and reached $265 million. Despite an increasing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence-based policymaking and development, the share of ODA dedicated to statistics hovered at around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.
Population and housing censuses are a primary source of the disaggregated data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring development policies and programmes. During the 10-year period spanning from 2006 to 2015, 90 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.
Over the period 2005-2014, birth registration data were available for 183 out of 230 countries or areas, whereas death registration data were available for 157. Only 58 per cent of developing countries with available data have birth registration coverage of 90 per cent or more; 71 per cent of developing countries with available data have death registration coverage of 75 per cent or more. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest levels of complete birth and death registration.
